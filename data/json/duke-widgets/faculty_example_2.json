        "abstract": "To retrospectively compare surgical success and complications between vaginal vault prolapse compared with uterovaginal prolapse in women who underwent apical prolapse repair for stage II-IV prolapse.Women in one of three Pelvic Floor Disorders Network prolapse surgical trials were included. Absence of bothersome bulge symptoms, no prolapse beyond the hymen, and no subsequent prolapse treatment defined success and was our primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included comparison of quality-of-life measures, anatomic changes, and adverse events. Pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q) and quality-of-life measures were administered at baseline and 1-2 years postoperatively. Comparisons were controlled for study site, age, body mass index, baseline POP-Q, apical and anterior or posterior repair performed, and prior prolapse repair. Outcomes measured at multiple time points were analyzed using longitudinal models to assess whether differences existed across study follow-up.Four hundred twenty-one women underwent vault prolapse, and 601 underwent uterovaginal prolapse apical repair. The vault prolapse group was older, more likely to be white, and to have prior urinary incontinence or prolapse repair, stage IV prolapse, and more prolapse bother on a validated scale (all P≤.034). The vault prolapse group was more likely to undergo sacrocolpopexy (228/421 [54%] vs 93/601 [15%]); the uterovaginal prolapse group was more likely to undergo vaginal repair (508/601 [85%] vs 193/421 [46%] P<.001). There were no differences in success (odds ratio [OR] 0.76 for vault prolapse vs uterovaginal prolapse, 95% CI 0.51-1.15, P=.20), changes in Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory scores (-79.4 vs -79.8, P=.89), postoperative POP-Q point C measurements (-7.0 vs -7.1 cm, P=.41), or serious adverse events (86/421 [20%] vs 90/601 [15%], P=.86) between groups. Among women who underwent a vaginal approach for repair of vault prolapse (n=193) or uterovaginal prolapse (n=508), there were no differences in success rates (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.43-1.04, P=.09) at 1-2 years postoperatively.Surgical success of stage II-IV vault prolapse and uterovaginal prolapse apical repair was similar whether performed vaginally or abdominally at 1-2 years postoperatively.",

        "abstract": "Little progress has been made in the prevention of pelvic floor disorders, despite their significant health and economic impact. The identification of women who are at risk remains a key element in targeting prevention and planning health resource allocation strategies. Although events around the time of childbirth are recognized clinically as important predictors, it is difficult to counsel women and to intervene around the time of childbirth because of an inability to convey a patient's risk accurately in the presence of multiple risk factors and the long time lapse, which is often decades, between obstetric events and the onset of pelvic floor disorders later in life. Prediction models and scoring systems have been used in other areas of medicine to identify patients who are at risk for chronic diseases. Models have been developed for use before delivery that predict short-term risk of pelvic floor disorders after childbirth, but no models that predict long-term risk exist.The purpose of this study was to use variables that are known before and during childbirth to develop and validate prognostic models that will estimate the risks of these disorders 12 and 20 years after delivery.Obstetric variables were collected from 2 cohorts: (1) women who gave birth in the United Kingdom and New Zealand (n=3763) and (2) women from the Swedish Medical Birth Register (n=4991). Pelvic floor disorders were self-reported 12 years after childbirth in the United Kingdom/New Zealand cohort and 20 years after childbirth in the Swedish Register. The cohorts were split so that data during the first half of the cohort's time period were used to fit prediction models, and validation was performed from the second half (temporal validation). Because there is currently no consensus on how to best define pelvic floor disorders from a patient's perspective, we chose to fit the data for each model using multiple outcome definitions for prolapse, urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence, ≥1 pelvic floor disorder, and ≥2 pelvic floor disorders. Model accuracy was measured in the following manner: (1) by ranking an individual's risk among all subjects in the cohort (discrimination) with the use of a concordance index and (2) by observing whether the predicted probability was too high or low (calibration) at a range of predicted probabilities with the use of visual plots.Models were able to discriminate between women who experienced bothersome symptoms or received treatment at 12 and 20 years, respectively, for pelvic organ prolapse (concordance indices, 0.570, 0.627), urinary incontinence (concordance indices, 0.653, 0.689), fecal incontinence (concordance indices, 0.618, 0.676), ≥1 pelvic floor disorders (concordance indices, 0.639, 0.675), and ≥2 pelvic floor disorders (concordance indices, 0.635, 0.619). Route of delivery and family history of each pelvic floor disorder were strong predictors in most models. Urinary incontinence before and during the index pregnancy was a strong predictor for the development of all pelvic floor disorders in most models 12 years after delivery. The 12- and 20-year bothersome symptoms or treatment for prolapse models were accurate when predictions were provided for risk from 0% to approximately 15%. The 12- and 20-year primiparous model began to over predict when risk rates reached 20%. When we predicted bothersome symptoms or treatment for urinary incontinence, the 12-year models were accurate when predictions ranged from approximately 5-60%; the 20-year primiparous models were accurate from 5% and 80%. For bothersome symptoms or treatment for fecal incontinence, the 12- and 20-year models were accurate from 1-15% risk and began to over predict at rates at >15% and 20%, respectively.Models may provide an opportunity before birth to identify women who are at low risk of the development of pelvic floor disorders and may provide institute prevention strategies such as pelvic floor muscle training, weight control, or elective cesarean section for women who are at higher risk.

        "abstract": "Today's educational environment has made it more difficult to rely on the Halstedian model of \"see one, do one, teach one\" in gynecologic surgical training. There is decreased surgical volume, but an increased number of surgical modalities. Fortunately, surgical simulation has evolved to fill the educational void. Whether it is through skill generalization or skill transfer, surgical simulation has shifted learning from the operating room back to the classroom. This article explores the principles of surgical education and ways to introduce simulation as an adjunct to residency training. We review high- and low-fidelity surgical simulators, discuss the progression of surgical skills, and provide options for skills competency assessment. Time and money are major hurdles when designing a simulation curriculum, but low-fidelity models, intradepartmental cost sharing, and utilizing local experts for simulation proctoring can aid in developing a simulation program.",

        "abstract": "There is significant need for trials evaluating the long-term effectiveness of a rigorous program of perioperative behavioral therapy with pelvic floor muscle training (BPMT) in women undergoing transvaginal reconstructive surgery for prolapse.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of perioperative BPMT on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and sexual function following vaginal surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and stress urinary incontinence (SUI).This study is a secondary report of a 2 × 2 factorial randomized controlled trial.This study was a multicenter trial.Participants were adult women with stage 2-4 POP and SUI.Perioperative BPMT versus usual care and sacrospinous ligament fixation (SSLF) versus uterosacral ligament suspension (ULS) were provided.Participants undergoing transvaginal surgery (SSLF or ULS for POP and a midurethral sling for SUI) received usual care or five perioperative BPMT visits. The primary outcome was change in body image and in Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ) short-form subscale, 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), Pelvic Organ Prolapse-Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire short form (PISQ-12), Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGII), and Brink scores.The 374 participants were randomized to BPMT (n = 186) and usual care (n = 188). Outcomes were available for 137 (74%) of BPMT participants and 146 (78%) of the usual care participants at 24 months. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in PFIQ, SF-36, PGII, PISQ-12, or body image scale measures.The clinicians providing BPMT had variable expertise. Findings might not apply to vaginal prolapse procedures without slings or abdominal apical prolapse procedures.Perioperative BPMT performed as an adjunct to vaginal surgery for POP and SUI provided no additional improvement in QOL or sexual function compared with usual care.",

        "abstract": "We sought to identify clinical and demographic characteristics associated with treatment response and satisfaction in women undergoing onabotulinumtoxinA and sacral neuromodulation therapies.We analyzed data from the ROSETTA (Refractory Overactive Bladder: Sacral NEuromodulation versus BoTulinum Toxin Assessment) trial. Baseline participant characteristics and clinical variables were associated with 2 definitions of treatment response, including 1) a reduction in mean daily urgency incontinence episodes during 6 months and 2) a 50% or greater decrease in urgency incontinence episodes across 6 months. The OAB-S (Overactive Bladder-Satisfaction) questionnaire was used to assess satisfaction.A greater reduction in mean daily urgency incontinence episodes was associated with higher HUI-3 (Health Utility Index-3) scores in the onabotulinumtoxinA group and higher baseline incontinence episodes (each p <0.001) in the 2 groups. Increased age was associated with a lesser decrease in incontinence episodes in the 2 groups (p <0.001). Increasing body mass index (adjusted OR 0.82/5 points, 95% CI 0.70-0.96) was associated with reduced achievement of a 50% or greater decrease in incontinence episodes after each treatment. Greater age (adjusted OR 0.44/10 years, 95% CI 0.30-0.65) and a higher functional comorbidity index (adjusted OR 0.84/1 point, 95% CI 0.71-0.99) were associated with reduced achievement of a 50% or greater decrease in urgency incontinence episodes in the onabotulinumtoxinA group only (p <0.001 and 0.041, respectively). In the onabotulinumtoxinA group increased satisfaction was noted with higher HUI-3 score (p = 0.002) but there was less satisfaction with higher age (p = 0.001).Older women with multiple comorbidities, and decreased functional and health related quality of life had decreased treatment response and satisfaction with onabotulinumtoxinA compared to sacral neuromodulation for refractory urgency incontinence.",

        "abstract": "An accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date problem list can help clinicians provide patient-centered care. Unfortunately, problem lists created and maintained in electronic health records by providers tend to be inaccurate, duplicative and out of date. With advances in machine learning and natural language processing, it is possible to automatically generate a problem list from the data in the EHR and keep it current. In this paper, we describe an automated problem list generation method and report on insights from a pilot study of physicians' assessment of the generated problem lists compared to existing providers-curated problem lists in an institution's EHR system.The natural language processing and machine learning-based Watson1 method models clinical thinking in identifying a patient's problem list using clinical notes and structured data. This pilot study assessed the Watson method and included 15 randomly selected, de-identified patient records from a large healthcare system that were each planned to be reviewed by at least two internal medicine physicians. The physicians created their own problem lists, and then evaluated the overall usefulness of their own problem lists (P), Watson generated problem lists (W), and the existing EHR problem lists (E) on a 10-point scale. The primary outcome was pairwise comparisons of P, W, and E.Six out of the 10 invited physicians completed 27 assessments of P, W, and E, and in process evaluated 732 Watson generated problems and 444 problems in the EHR system. As expected, physicians rated their own lists, P, highest. However, W was rated higher than E. Among 89% of assessments, Watson identified at least one important problem that physicians missed.Cognitive computing systems like this Watson system hold the potential for accurate, problem-list-centered summarization of patient records, potentially leading to increased efficiency, better clinical decision support, and improved quality of patient care.",

The final survey was developed from an iterative process using subject and expert endorsement, factor analyses, and response distributions. Domains were created using a development cohort (n = 304 women), reliability and validity were established using a validation cohort (n = 596 women), and test-retest reliability was assessed (n = 111 women).Factor analyses supported an 11-item avoidance domain and a 6-item hygiene domain. Cronbach' alphas were 0.88 and 0.68, respectively. Test-retest reliability was 0.84 for both domains. Construct validity was demonstrated in correlations between the ABI domains and baseline PFDI and PFIQ (r values, 0.43-0.79 with all P values <0.0001). Moreover, the ABI accounted for 8% to 26% of unexplained variance between the symptoms severity measure and the impact on health related quality of life. After treatment, avoidance domain scores improved for urinary and fecal incontinence groups and hygiene scores improved for the fecal incontinence group.The ABI is a reliable and valid measure in women with pelvic floor disorders. Adaptive behaviors account in part for discordance between pelvic floor symptom severity and bother.",

        "abstract": "To compare prevalence and severity of any surgical pain between transobturator and retropubic slings; secondary aims were to compare pain at anatomic locations, pain medication use, and pain resolution between transobturator and retropubic slings and to compare pain between types of transobturator slings.This is a secondary analysis of the Trial of Mid-Urethral Slings, which compared retropubic and transobturator sling outcomes and included 597 participants from 2006 to 2008. Postoperative assessments included body maps, visual analog scales, Surgical Pain Scales, and medication inventories for 30 days, at 6 weeks, and 6, 12, and 24 months. Postoperative pain prevalence and severity were compared. Mixed models compared pain resolution and severity over time. Regression models compared pain prevalence and severity between types of transobturator slings. Eighty percent power was provided for the primary outcome pain prevalence and 95% power was provided for the primary outcome pain severity.Postoperative prevalence of any surgical pain, pain severity, and pain medication was not different between retropubic and transobturator slings. Retropubic sling was associated with greater prevalence of suprapubic pain at 2 weeks (proportion difference 10.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.6-16.4%; P<.001). Transobturator sling was associated with greater prevalence of groin pain at 2 weeks (proportion difference 12.0%; 95% CI 7.1-16.8%; P<.001). There was no difference in pain resolution (odds ratio [OR] 1.11, 95% CI 0.88-1.40; P=.38). Between types of transobturator slings, the odds of surgical pain were similar at 2 (OR 2.39, 95% CI 0.51-11.31; P=.27) and 6 weeks (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.02-9.20; P=.61).Transobturator and retropubic slings are associated with low prevalence of any surgical pain. Transobturator sling was associated with greater prevalence of groin pain at 2 weeks, and retropubic sling was associated with greater prevalence of suprapubic pain at 2 weeks. Surgical pain resolved quickly in both groups.",

        "abstract": "To establish validity for the Pelvic Floor Disorders Network (PFDN) self-administered Adaptive Behavior Index (ABI) and to assess whether ABI assesses known discordance between severity of pelvic floor symptoms and self-reported bother.In addition to the ABI questionnaire, participants in 1 of 6 Pelvic Floor Disorders Network trials completed condition-specific measures of pretreatment symptom severity (including Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory; PFDI) and health-related quality of life (Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire; PFIQ). The final survey was developed from an iterative process using subject and expert endorsement, factor analyses, and response distributions. Domains were created using a development cohort (n = 304 women), reliability and validity were established using a validation cohort (n = 596 women), and test-retest reliability was assessed (n = 111 women).Factor analyses supported an 11-item avoidance domain and a 6-item hygiene domain. Cronbach' alphas were 0.88 and 0.68, respectively. Test-retest reliability was 0.84 for both domains. Construct validity was demonstrated in correlations between the ABI domains and baseline PFDI and PFIQ (r values, 0.43-0.79 with all P values <0.0001). Moreover, the ABI accounted for 8% to 26% of unexplained variance between the symptoms severity measure and the impact on health related quality of life. After treatment, avoidance domain scores improved for urinary and fecal incontinence groups and hygiene scores improved for the fecal incontinence group.The ABI is a reliable and valid measure in women with pelvic floor disorders. Adaptive behaviors account in part for discordance between pelvic floor symptom severity and bother.",

Rome III clinical criteria defined IBS. Women also self-reported having an IBS diagnosis. Baseline questionnaires included the following: Modified Manchester Health Questionnaire, Fecal Incontinence Severity Index, Bristol Stool Scale, Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory, and the Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire.Of the 133 women enrolled, 119 completed Rome III IBS questionnaires, and 111 reported on whether they had a previous diagnosis of IBS. The prevalence of IBS was 31% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.9%-40.2%) according to the Rome III IBS criteria. The most common subtypes were IBS-mixed (41%) and IBS-diarrhea (35%). Twenty-four (22%) of 111 patients had a previous diagnosis of IBS. Among women who met Rome III IBS criteria, 23 (66%) of 35 women had never had a diagnosis of IBS. Women with FI and IBS reported significantly worse QOL compared to women without IBS despite similar FI severity and stool consistency.Irritable bowel syndrome negatively affects QOL and affects one third of women with FI presenting for care in tertiary centers. Our findings suggest that assessment of IBS symptoms and diagnosis may be important for women presenting for FI treatment.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to estimate rates of recurrent pelvic organ prolapse (POP) 6 years after patients underwent transvaginal uterosacral colpopexy, or laparoscopic or robotic sacral colpopexy at a large tertiary care center. We hypothesized that recurrence rates would be higher than those previously reported.This is a retrospective study of women who underwent uterosacral colpopexy, laparoscopic, and robotic sacral colpopexy for treatment of POP between 2006 and 2012. A composite outcome for recurrent POP was defined as subjective failure (vaginal bulge symptoms), objective failure (prolapse to or beyond the hymen), or any retreatment for POP (reoperation or use of a pessary). Kaplan-Meier survival curves were generated from each patient's date of follow-up, and parametric survival modeling was used to estimate recurrent POP over 6 years. Annual estimated recurrence rates by type of colpopexy are reported using the composite and individual definitions for recurrent POP.One thousand three hundred eighty-one subjects met inclusion criteria: 983 (71.1 %) uterosacral, 256 (18.5%) laparoscopic, and 142 (11.2%) robotic colpopexies. Median (range) months to failure using composite recurrence were as follows: uterosacral, 17.1 (7.6-41); laparoscopic, 10.1 (4.7-25.1); robotic, 9.7 (1.6-17.2). By year 6 in the model, the estimated composite recurrence rates for the uterosacral colpopexy, robotic, and laparoscopic sacral colpopexy groups were 43%, 49%, and 57%, respectively.Estimated recurrence rates for uterosacral ligament colpopexy, laparoscopic, and robotic sacral colpopexy may be as high as 40% to 60% 6 years after surgery.",

        "abstract": "A model that predicts a patient's risk of receiving a blood transfusion may facilitate selective preoperative testing and more efficient perioperative blood management utilization.We sought to construct and validate a model that predicts a patient's risk of receiving a blood transfusion after gynecologic surgery.In all, 18,319 women who underwent gynecologic surgery at 10 institutions in a single health system by 116 surgeons from January 2010 through June 2014 were analyzed. The data set was split into a model training cohort of 12,219 surgeries performed from January 2010 through December 2012 and a separate validation cohort of 6100 surgeries performed from January 2013 through June 2014. In all, 47 candidate risk factors for transfusion were collected. Multiple logistic models were fit onto the training cohort to predict transfusion within 30 days of surgery. Variables were removed using stepwise backward reduction to find the best parsimonious model. Model discrimination was measured using the concordance index. The model was internally validated using 1000 bootstrapped samples and temporally validated by testing the model's performance in the validation cohort. Calibration and decision curves were plotted to inform clinicians about the accuracy of predicted probabilities and whether the model adds clinical benefit when making decisions.The transfusion rate in the training cohort was 2% (95% confidence interval, 1.72-2.22). The model had excellent discrimination and calibration during internal validation (bias-corrected concordance index, 0.906; 95% confidence interval, 0.890-0.928) and maintained accuracy during temporal validation using the separate validation cohort (concordance index, 0.915; 95% confidence interval, 0.872-0.954). Calibration curves demonstrated the model was accurate up to 40% then it began to overpredict risk. The model provides superior net benefit when clinical decision thresholds are between 0-50% predicted risk.This model accurately predicts a patient's risk of transfusion after gynecologic surgery facilitating selective preoperative testing and more efficient perioperative blood management utilization.",

        "abstract": "Standardized training and clinical protocols using biofeedback for the treatment of fecal incontinence (FI) are important for clinical care. Our primary aims were to develop, implement, and evaluate adherence to a standardized protocol for manometric biofeedback to treat FI.In a Pelvic Floor Disorders Network (PFDN) trial, participants were enrolled from eight PFDN clinical centers across the United States. A team of clinical and equipment experts developed biofeedback software on a novel tablet computer platform for conducting standardized anorectal manometry with separate manometric biofeedback protocols for improving anorectal muscle strength, sensation, and urge resistance. The training protocol also included education on bowel function, anal sphincter exercises, and bowel diary monitoring. Study interventionists completed online training prior to attending a centralized, standardized certification course. For the certification, expert trainers assessed the ability of the interventionists to perform the protocol components for a paid volunteer who acted as a standardized patient. Postcertification, the trainers audited interventionists during trial implementation to improve protocol adherence.Twenty-four interventionists attended the in-person training and certification, including 46% advanced practice registered nurses (11/24), 50% (12/24) physical therapists, and 4% physician assistants (1/24). Trainers performed audio audits for 88% (21/24), representing 84 audited visits. All certified interventionists met or exceeded the prespecified 80% pass rate for the audit process, with an average passing rate of 93%.A biofeedback protocol can be successfully imparted to experienced pelvic floor health care providers from various disciplines. Our process promoted high adherence to a standard protocol and is applicable to many clinical settings.",

We describe the protocol design and rationale for the Effects of Surgical Treatment Enhanced with Exercise for Mixed Urinary Incontinence (ESTEEM) trial, designed to compare a combined conservative and surgical treatment approach versus surgery alone for improving patient-centered MUI outcomes at 12 months.ESTEEM is a multisite, prospective, randomized trial of female participants with MUI randomized to a standardized perioperative behavioral/pelvic floor exercise intervention plus midurethral sling versus midurethral sling alone. We describe our methods and four challenges encountered during the design phase: defining the study population, selecting relevant patient-centered outcomes, determining sample size estimates using a patient-reported outcome measure, and designing an analysis plan that accommodates MUI failure rates. A central theme in the design was patient centeredness, which guided many key decisions. Our primary outcome is patient-reported MUI symptoms measured using the Urogenital Distress Inventory (UDI) score at 12 months. Secondary outcomes include quality of life, sexual function, cost-effectiveness, time to failure, and need for additional treatment.The final study design was implemented in November 2013 across eight clinical sites in the Pelvic Floor Disorders Network. As of 27 February 2016, 433 total/472 targeted participants had been randomized.We describe the ESTEEM protocol and our methods for reaching consensus for methodological challenges in designing a trial for MUI by maintaining the patient perspective at the core of key decisions. This trial will provide information that can directly impact patient care and clinical decision making.",

        "abstract": "Depression has been associated with symptom amplification, functional impairment, and lower incontinence-specific quality of life in women with urinary incontinence. Although depression has been shown to impact both subjective and objective outcomes after many different surgeries, there are limited data on the effects of major depression on postoperative outcomes after antiincontinence surgery.The purpose of this study was to determine whether major depression affects urinary incontinence severity and quality of life after midurethral sling surgery.This was a secondary analysis of the Trial of Midurethral Slings. Participants were assigned randomly either to a retropubic or transobturator sling for stress urinary incontinence. Each was classified as having major depression or not by the validated depression screening Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Pre- and postoperative urinary incontinence severity (which was assessed by the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire), urinary incontinence-specific quality of life (which was assessed by the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire and the Urinary Distress Inventory), and sexual function (which was assessed by the Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire) was compared between groups at baseline and at 12 months.Five hundred twenty-six patients were included: 79 patients (15%) had major depression before surgery; 447 patients (85%) did not. Baseline incontinence severity was higher in women with major depression than in those without (International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire, 14.7 ± 4.1 vs 12.9 ± 4.0; P < .001). Similarly, baseline quality of life and sexual function were worse in depressed women than in nondepressed women (Incontinence Impact Questionnaire, 235.6 ± 95.8 vs 134.8 ± 89.8; P < .001; Urinary Distress Inventory, 162.7 ± 46 vs 128.6 ± 41.3; P < .001; and Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire-12, 27.2 ± 7.3 vs 33.9 ± 6.4; P < .001). After adjustment for differences between groups, baseline major depression did not negatively affect 12-month incontinence severity or quality of life. However, at 12 months after surgery, despite significant improvement in sexual function scores in depressed women, the 12-month scores were still significantly worse in the major depression group (Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire-12, 34.1 ± 7.1 vs 37.7 ± 6.1; P < .001); multivariable analysis showed independent association of baseline major depression with 12-month sexual function. At 12 months, 83% of those women (66/79) with baseline major depression were no longer depressed.Women with major depression who are planning surgery for stress urinary incontinence have worse quality of life than nondepressed women. However, women with major depression improve significantly more than those without major depression such that, at 12 months postoperatively, incontinence severity and quality of life are not different between groups. Sexual function is worse before and after the operation for depressed women.",

        "abstract": "Many women choosing to have surgery for pelvic organ prolapse also choose to undergo continence surgery. This review focuses on available evidence that clinicians may use to counsel patients when choosing whether to perform continence surgery and how predictive analytic tools improve this decision-making process.Midurethral sling, Burch cystourethropexy and bladder neck sling are highly effective for the surgical treatment of stress urinary incontinence. Trials demonstrate that continence surgery may be routinely performed to reduce the risk of postoperative incontinence in women undergoing surgery for pelvic organ prolapse with or without preoperative stress urinary incontinence. Although these procedures are effective and well tolerated on average, media concerns, regulatory warnings and litigation reinforce the need for a balanced discussion regarding efficacy and potential adverse events directed at the individual patient during the preoperative visit. Advances in predictive analytics allow surgeons to quantitate individual risk using algorithms that tailor estimates for the individual patient and facilitate shared understanding of risks and benefits. These models are less prone to cognitive biases and frequently outperform experienced clinicians.This review discusses how predictive analytic tools can be used to improve decisions about continence surgery in the woman planning to undergo prolapse surgery.",

        "abstract": "To assess long-term bowel symptoms in women who underwent segmental bowel resection for deep-infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) compared with women who underwent resection of severe endometriosis without bowel resection.Cohort study with matched controls (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).Cleveland Clinic.71 patients (36 cases and 35 controls).Patients who were at least 4 years out from undergoing segmental bowel resection due to DIE were matched with patients who had undergone resection of stage III/IV endometriosis without bowel resection. The patients completed validated questionnaires, and data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum, χ(2), and Fisher exact tests.The Bristol Stool Form Scale, Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms Questionnaire (PAC-SYM), and St Mark's Vaizey Fecal Incontinence Grading System were used to elicit information. The median duration of follow-up was 10.1 years (range, 4-18 years). The mean patient age and body mass index were comparable in the cases and the controls. A larger proportion of cases than controls reported new bowel symptoms (58% [21 of 36] vs 14% [5 of 35]; p = .001), as well as abdominal pain, incomplete bowel movements, and false alarms on the PAC-SYM questionnaire; however, total PAC-SYM and Vaizey Fecal Incontinence Grading System scores were similar in the 2 groups (median, 8 [interquartile range, 8-10] vs 8 [8-10]; p = .86). Similarly, the proportion of patients with normal stool consistency (Bristol Stool Form Scale score 2-6) was similar in the 2 groups (80.6% [29 of 36] vs 94.3% [33 of 35]; p = .59).Segmental bowel resection for DIE may be associated with a higher incidence of new bowel symptoms (possibly due to abdominal pain, incomplete bowel movements, and/or false alarms), but not with worse constipation or fecal incontinence, compared with surgery without bowel resection.",

        "abstract": "Intravenous indigo carmine has routinely been used to confirm ureteral patency after urogynecologic surgery. Recent discontinuation of the dye has altered clinical practice. In the absence of indigo carmine, we have used 10% dextrose in sterile water (D10) as cystoscopic fluid to evaluate ureteral patency. Glucosuria has been associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) in vivo and significantly enhanced bacterial growth in vitro. The concern is that the use of D10 would mimic a state of glucosuria albeit transient and increase the risk of postoperative UTI.The objectives of this study were to compare the rates of postoperative UTI and lower urinary tract (LUT) injuries between patients who underwent instillation of D10 vs normal saline at the time of intraoperative cystoscopy after urogynecological surgery.This was a retrospective cohort study of all women who underwent cystoscopic evaluation of ureteral patency at the time of urogynecological surgery from May through December 2014 at a tertiary care referral center. We compared patients who received D10 cystoscopy fluid vs those who used normal saline. Outcomes included UTI and diagnosis of ureteral or LUT injuries. UTI was diagnosed according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines by symptoms alone, urine dipstick, urinalysis, or urine culture. Descriptive statistics compared the rates of UTI between the 2 groups, and a multivariable model was fit to the data to control for potential confounders and significant baseline differences between the groups.A total of 303 women were included. D10 was used in 113 cases and normal saline (NS) was used in 190. The rate of UTI was higher in the D10 group than the NS group: 47.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 38.3-57.4) vs 25.9% (95% CI, 19.8-32.8, P < .001). After adjusting for age, pelvic organ prolapse stage, use of perioperative estrogen, days of postoperative catheterization, menopausal status, diabetes mellitus, and history of recurrent UTI, the UTI rate remained significantly higher with the use of D10 (adjusted odds ratio, 3.4 [95% CI, 1.6-7.5], P = .002) compared with NS. Overall, 3 cases of transient ureteral kinking (1.0%) and one cystotomy (0.3%) were identified intraoperatively. However, ureteral and LUT injuries were not different between groups. No unidentified injuries presented postoperatively.Although the use of D10 cystoscopy fluid has been successful in identifying ureteral patency in the absence of indigo carmine, it is associated with an increased rate of postoperative UTI compared with NS.",

        "abstract": "To construct and validate models that predict a patient's risk of developing stress and urgency urinary incontinence and adverse events 12 months after sling surgery.This was a secondary analysis of four randomized trials. Twenty-five candidate predictors (patient characteristics and urodynamic variables) were identified from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Trial of Mid-Urethral Slings (N=597). Multiple logistic models were fit to predict four different outcomes: 1) bothersome stress urinary incontinence; 2) a positive stress test; 3) bothersome urgency urinary incontinence; and 4) any adverse event up to 12 months after sling surgery. Model discrimination was measured using a concordance index. Each model's concordance index was internally validated using 1,000 bootstrap samples and calibration curves were plotted. Final models were externally validated on a separate data set (n=902) from a combination of three different multicenter randomized trials.Four best models discriminated on internal validation between women with bothersome stress urinary incontinence (concordance index 0.728, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.683-0.773), a positive stress test (concordance index 0.712, 95% CI 0.669-0.758), bothersome urgency urinary incontinence (concordance index 0.722, 95% CI 0.680-0.764), and any adverse event (concordance index 0.640, 95% CI 0.595-0.681) after sling surgery. Each model's concordance index was reduced as expected when important variables were removed for external validation, but model discrimination remained stable with bothersome stress urinary incontinence (concordance index 0.548), a positive stress test (concordance index 0.656), bothersome urgency urinary incontinence (concordance index 0.621), and any adverse event (concordance index 0.567). Predicted probabilities are closest to actual probabilities when predictions are less than 50%.Four best and modified models discriminate between women who will and will not develop urinary incontinence and adverse events 12 months after midurethral sling surgery 64-73% and 55-66% of the time, respectively.",

We sought to describe adherence with anticholinergic (AC) versus placebo (P) by comparing pill counts and MEMSCAP event data and to identify factors associated with adherence.The randomized controlled AC versus Botox Comparison trial of women with moderate to severe idiopathic UUI included 126 participants initiating AC plus P bladder injection and 121 receiving P pills plus Botox injection. Adherence data on 243 participants (124 AC and 119 P) were calculated by pill count and MEMSCAP data for each 2-month interval during the 6-month study that allowed for dose escalation/drug change. Overall composite adherence estimates were calculated using the average of both methods and weighted by the duration of each 2-month interval.Treatment groups had no significant differences in dosing duration (P = 0.76) or mean adherence (AC, 83.3% [16.8] vs. P, 84.8% [13.8]). Only 53% of women met the dichotomous outcome of more than 80% adherence during all intervals. Correlation between adherence by pill counts versus MEMSCAP decreased over time with pill counts demonstrating higher adherence than MEMSCAP (r = 0.53, 0.50, and 0.36 for each 2-month interval). Lower adherence was associated with higher baseline incontinence severity and better UUI quality of life for the AC group and with current smoking status in both groups.Adherence using pill counts and MEMSCAP was reasonably correlated and similar in both the AC and P groups. In the AC group, higher baseline incontinence severity and better UUI Quality of Life were associated with decreased adherence. Smokers were less adherent.",

        "abstract": "The goals of this trial are to determine the efficacy and safety of two treatments for women experiencing fecal incontinence. First, we aim to compare the use of loperamide to placebo and second, to compare the use of anal sphincter exercises with biofeedback to usual care. The primary outcome is the change from baseline in the St. Mark's (Vaizey) Score 24weeks after treatment initiation. As a Pelvic Floor Disorders Network (PFDN) trial, subjects are enrolling from eight PFDN clinical centers across the United States. A centralized data coordinating center supervises data collection and analysis. These two first-line treatments for fecal incontinence are being investigated simultaneously using a two-by-two randomized factorial design: a medication intervention (loperamide versus placebo) and a pelvic floor strength and sensory training intervention (anal sphincter exercises with manometry-assisted biofeedback versus usual care using an educational pamphlet). Interventionists providing the anal sphincter exercise training with biofeedback have received standardized training and assessment. Symptom severity, diary, standardized anorectal manometry and health-related quality of life outcomes are assessed using validated instruments administered by researchers masked to randomized interventions. Cost effectiveness analyses will be performed using prospectively collected data on care costs and resource utilization. This article describes the rationale and design of this randomized trial, focusing on specific research concepts of interest to researchers in the field of female pelvic floor disorders and all other providers who care for patients with fecal incontinence.",

Third-degree OASIs were characterized using World Health Organization criteria, 3a (<50%) or 3b (>50%) tear through the sphincter. Fecal incontinence was defined as leakage of liquid/solid stool and/or mucus in the past month; AI was defined as leakage of liquid/solid stool and/or mucus and/or gas in the past month and was assessed at 6, 12, and 24 weeks postpartum using the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index. Logistic regression identified variables associated with AI.Three hundred forty-three women participated: 297 subjects sustained a third-degree OASI, 168 type 3a, 98 type 3b and 31 indeterminant; 45 had a fourth-degree OASI. Overall FI incidence at 6, 12, and 24 weeks was 7% [23/326; 95% confidence interval (CI), 4%-10%], 4% (6/145; 95% CI, 2%-9%), and 9% (13/138; 95% CI, 5%-16%), respectively. At 24 weeks, AI incidence was 24% (95% CI, 17%-32%) and fecal urgency 21% (95% CI, 15%-29%). No significant differences in FI and AI rates were noted by third-degree type or between groups with third and fourth OASI. Flatal incontinence was greater in women sustaining a fourth-degree tear (35% vs 16%, P = 0.04). White race (adjusted odds ratio, 4.64; 95% CI, 1.35-16.02) and shorter duration of second stage (adjusted odds ratio, 1.47 per 30 minute decrease; 95% CI, 1.12-1.92) were associated with AI at 24 weeks.Overall 24-week incidence of FI is 9% (95% CI, 5%-16%) and AI is 24% (95% CI, 17%-32%). In women with OASI, white race and shorter second-stage labor were associated with postpartum AI.NCT01166399 (http://clinicaltrials.gov).",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe perioperative and postoperative adverse events associated with uterosacral colpopexy, to describe the rate of recurrent pelvic organ prolapse (POP) associated with uterosacral colpopexy, and to determine whether surgeon technique and suture choice are associated with these rates. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective chart review of women who underwent uterosacral colpopexy for POP from January 2006 through December 2011 at a single tertiary care center. The electronic medical record was queried for demographic, intraoperative, and postoperative data. Strict definitions were used for all clinically relevant adverse events. Recurrent POP was defined as the following: symptomatic vaginal bulge, prolapse to or beyond the hymen, or any retreatment for POP. RESULTS: In all, 983 subjects met study inclusion criteria. The overall adverse event rate was 31.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29.2-38.6), which included 20.3% (95% CI, 17.9-23.6) of subjects with postoperative urinary tract infections. Of all adverse events, 3.4% were attributed to a preexisting medical condition, while all other events were ascribed to the surgical intervention. Vaginal hysterectomy, age, and operative time were not significantly associated with any adverse event. The intraoperative bladder injury rate was 1% (95% CI, 0.6-1.9) and there were no intraoperative ureteral injuries; 4.5% (95% CI, 3.4-6.0) of cases were complicated by ureteral kinking requiring suture removal. The rates of pulmonary and cardiac complications were 2.3% (95% CI, 1.6-3.5) and 0.8% (95% CI, 0.4-1.6); and the rates of postoperative ileus and small bowel obstruction were 0.1% (95% CI, 0.02-0.6) and 0.8% (95% CI, 0.4-1.6). The composite recurrent POP rate was 14.4% (95% CI, 12.4-16.8): 10.6% (95% CI, 8.8-12.7) of patients experienced vaginal bulge symptoms, 11% (95% CI, 9.2-13.1) presented with prolapse to or beyond the hymen, and 3.4% (95% CI, 2.4-4.7) required retreatment. Number and type of suture used were not associated with a higher rate of recurrence. Of the subjects who required unilateral removal of sutures to resolve ureteral kinking, 63.6% did not undergo suture replacement; this was not associated with a higher rate of POP recurrence. CONCLUSION: Perioperative and postoperative complication rates associated with severe morbidity after uterosacral colpopexy appear to be low. Uterosacral colpopexy remains a safe option for the treatment of vaginal vault prolapse.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare the backfill standard voiding trial (SVT) that relies on the assessment of voided volume to subjective patients' evaluation of their voiding based on the assessment of the force of stream (FOS) after an outpatient midurethral sling surgery. STUDY DESIGN: This double-blinded randomized trial included patients undergoing an outpatient midurethral sling surgery without any other concomitant surgery. Participants were randomized to either the SVT group or to the FOS group. The primary outcome was the rate of catheterization any time up to 6 weeks after surgery. Both groups underwent the same backfill voiding trial protocol postoperatively. Measurements of the voided amount, postvoid residual, and the response to the FOS visual analog scale were collected. The criteria for passing the voiding trial in the SVT group was voiding at least two-thirds of the instilled amount; while the criteria for passing the trial in the FOS group was assessment of FOS at least 50% of the baseline, regardless of the voided volume. Participants were interviewed preoperatively and 2-4 days, 7-9 days, and 6 weeks postoperatively. All postoperative interviews included assessments of pain, tolerance of physical activity, urinary FOS, as well as satisfaction with the surgery. Validated questionnaires (Incontinence Severity Index and Urinary Distress Inventory, short form) before the surgery and 6 weeks after were used to evaluate urinary symptoms. RESULTS: A total of 108 patients were enrolled and randomized, and 6-week follow-up data were available for 102 participants (FOS 50, SVT 52). The 2 groups were similar with respect to demographic characteristics and urinary symptoms. The incidence of catheterization was also similar between the groups (FOS 13 [26%], SVT 13 [25.5%]; P=.95). Amount voided had a moderate correlation with FOS assessment (Spearman rho 0.5; P<.001). There was no significant difference in mean catheter days, pain scores, Incontinence Severity Index, and Urinary Distress Inventory, short form scores between the 2 groups. Of the patients who were discharged home without a catheter in either group none required catheter reinsertion within 6 weeks after the surgery. CONCLUSION: Patient's subjective assessment of the urinary FOS correlated well with the measured voided amount and no difference in catheterization days was noted between the subjective and objective assessment of voiding. Thus subjective evaluation of the FOS is a reliable and safe method to use after outpatient midurethral surgery.",

Women included had a primary complaint of at least monthly FI over 3 consecutive months and planned FI treatment. Demographic and medical history data were obtained at baseline. Data were collected at baseline, 3 months, and 12 months after clinically selected, nonstandardized treatment. Validated questionnaires were as follows: Fecal Incontinence Severity Index, Modified Manchester Health Questionnaire, Pelvic Floor Disorders Inventory's Colorectal and Anal Distress Inventory, Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire's Colorectal and Anal Impact Questionnaire, and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form. Questionnaire score changes from baseline were compared using paired t tests at 3 and 12 months after treatment.Of the 133 women enrolled, 90 women had treatment data at 3 months and 77 at 12 months. Nonsurgical therapies were the most common (78%) with anal sphincter repair in 22%. Fecal Incontinence Severity Index scores and Modified Manchester Health Questionnaire scores significantly improved 3 months after nonsurgical and surgical treatments (-8.8 ± 12.0 and -12.6 ± 19.2, respectively, P < 0.001), as did Colorectal-Anal Distress Inventory and Colorectal-Anal Impact Questionnaire scores (-52.7 ± 70.0 and -60.6 ± 70.0, respectively, P < 0.001) and Medical Outcomes Study Short Form mental health scores (4.2 ± 9.4, P = 0.001). Improvement persisted 12 months posttreatment.In women seeking care for FI, symptom severity and condition-specific quality of life significantly improve within the first 3 months after FI treatment and are maintained up to 12 months.",

We present a case of successful removal of a retropubic midurethral sling from the urethra using a head lamp and a combination of ear, nose, and throat instruments. CASE: A 63-year-old woman presented to our clinic with the symptom of gross hematuria after having undergone a TVT procedure. On office cystoscopy, the sling was noted to be placed within the urethral mucosa. Removal of the mesh was performed using a nasal speculum, left and right ethmoid scissors, left and right Blakesley graspers, and a head lamp to dissect the mesh directly out of the urethra. CONCLUSION: The utilization of ear, nose, and throat tools allowed us to resect the intraurethral mesh without necessitating incision of the urethral sphincter.",

Patient responses were primarily anchored using a Global Impression of Change scale. The MID was defined as the difference in mean change from baseline between those who indicated they were \"a little better\" and those who reported \"no change\" on the Global Impression of Change scale 3 months after treatment. The effect size and SE of measurement were the distribution methods used.The mean changes (SD) in FISI, CRADI, CRAIQ, and MMHQ scores from baseline to 3 months after treatment were -8.8 (12.0), -52.7 (70.0), -60.6 (90.0), and -12.6 (19.2), respectively. The anchor-based MID estimates suggested by an improvement from no change to a little better were -3.6, -11.4 and -4.7, -18.1 and -8.0, and -3.2 for the FISI, CRADI (long and short version), CRAIQ (long and short version), and MMHQ, respectively. These data were supported by 2 distribution-based estimates.The MID values for the FISI are -4, CRADI (full version, -11; short version, -5), CRAIQ (full version, -18; short version, -8), and MMHQ -3. Statistically significant improvements that meet these thresholds are likely to be clinically important.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Our first objective was to compare peri- and postoperative adverse events between robotic-assisted laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (RSC) and conventional laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy (LSC) in a cohort of women who underwent these procedures at a tertiary care center. Our second objective was to explore whether hysterectomy and rectopexy at the time of sacrocolpopexy were associated with these adverse events. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study of women who underwent either RSC or LSC with or without concomitant hysterectomy and/or rectopexy from 2006-2012. Once patients were identified as either having undergone RSC or LSC, the electronic medical record was queried for demographic, peri-, and postoperative data. RESULTS: Four hundred six women met study inclusion criteria. Mean age and body mass index of all the women were 58 ± 10 years and 27.9 ± 4.9 kg/m(2). The women who underwent RSC were older (60 ± 9 vs 57 ± 10 years, respectively; P = .009) and more likely to be postmenopausal (90.9% vs 79.1%, respectively; P = .05). RSC cases were associated with a higher intraoperative bladder injury rate (3.3% vs 0.4%, respectively; P = .04), a higher rate of estimated blood loss of ≥500 mL (2.5% vs 0, respectively; P = .01), and reoperation rate for pelvic organ prolapse (4.9% vs 1.1%, respectively; P = .02) compared with LSC. Concomitant rectopexy was associated with a higher risk of transfusion (2.8% vs 0.3%, respectively; P = .04), pelvic/abdominal abscess formation (11.1% vs 0.8%, respectively; P < .001), and osteomyelitis (5.6% vs 0, respectively; P < .001). The mesh erosion rate for all the women was 2.7% and was not statistically different between LSC and RSC and for patients who underwent concomitant hysterectomy and those who did not. CONCLUSION: Peri- and postoperative outcomes after RSC and LSC are favorable, with few adverse outcomes. RSC is associated with a higher rate of bladder injury, estimated blood loss ≥500 mL, and reoperation for recurrent pelvic organ prolapse; otherwise, the rate of adverse events is similar between the 2 modalities. Concomitant rectopexy is associated with a higher rate of postoperative abscess and osteomyelitis complications.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to describe posterior prolapse (pPOP) and obstructed defecation (OD) symptoms 5 years after open abdominal sacrocolpopexy (ASC).We grouped the extended colpopexy and urinary reduction efforts trial participants with baseline and 5-year outcomes into 3 groups using baseline posterior Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) points and concomitant posterior repair (PR) (no PR, Ap <0; no PR, Ap ≥0; and +PR). Posterior colporrhaphy, perineorrhaphy, or sacrocolpoperineopexy were included as PR, which was performed at surgeon's discretion. Outcomes were dichotomized into presence/absence of pPOP (Ap ≥0) and OD symptoms (≥2 on 1 or more questions about digital assistance, excessive straining, or incomplete evacuation). Composite failure was defined by both pPOP and OD symptoms or pPOP reoperation.Ninety participants completed baseline and 5-year outcomes or were retreated with mean follow-up of 7.1 ± 1.0 years. Of those with no PR (Ap <0), 2 women (2/36; 9%) developed new pPOP with OD symptoms; 1 underwent subsequent PR. Nearly all (23/24; 96%) with no PR (Ap ≥0) demonstrated sustained resolution of pPOP, and none underwent PR. Fourteen percent (4/29) of +PR underwent repeat PR within 5 years, and 12% had recurrent pPOP. Regardless of PR, OD symptoms improved in all groups after ASC, although OD symptoms were still present in 17% to 19% at 5 years.Symptomatic pPOP is common 5 years after ASC regardless of concomitant PR. Obstructed defecation symptoms may improve after ASC regardless of PR. Recurrent pPOP and/or reoperation was highest among those who received concomitant PR at ASC. Further studies identifying criteria for concomitant PR at the time of ASC are warranted.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To measure surgical judgment across the Obstetrics and Gynecology (OBGYN) continuum of practice and identify factors that correlate with improved surgical judgment. METHODS: A 45-item written examination was developed using script concordance theory, which compares an examinee's responses to a series of \"ill-defined\" surgical scenarios to a reference panel of experts. The examination was administered to OBGYN residents, Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery (FPMRS) fellows, practicing OBGYN physicians and FPMRS experts. Surgical judgment was evaluated by comparing scores against the experts. Factors related to surgical experience were measured for association with scores. RESULTS: In total, 147 participants including 11 residents, 37 fellows, 88 practicing physicians and 11 experts completed the 45-item examination. Mean scores for practicing physicians (65.2 ± 7.4) were similar to residents (67.2 ± 7.1), and worse than fellows (72.6 ± 4.2, p < 0.001) and experts (80 ± 5, p < 0.001). Positive correlations between scores and surgical experience included: annual number of vaginal hysterectomies (r = 0.32, p = <0.001), robotic hysterectomies (r = 0.17, p = 0.048), stress incontinence (r = 0.29, p < 0.001) and prolapse procedures (r = 0.37, p < 0.001). Inverse correlation was seen between test scores and years in practice. (r = -0.19, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Intraoperative judgment in practicing OBGYN physicians appears similar to resident physicians. Practicing physicians who perform FPMRS procedures perform poorly on this examination of surgical judgment; lower performance correlates with less surgical experience and the greater amount of time in practice.",

        "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: To develop a valid laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy simulation model for use as an assessment and learning tool for performing this procedure. DESIGN: Simulation study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2). SETTING: Two tertiary academic centers. INTERVENTION: A training model was developed to simulate performance of a laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy. Construct validity was measured by comparing observed masked performances on the model between experienced Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgeons (experts) and upper level trainees. All videotaped performances were scored by 2 surgeons who were masked to subject identity and using the valid and reliable Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills scale. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The expert group included Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgeons (n = 5) experienced in laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy, and the trainee group (n = 15) included fourth-year gynecology residents (n = 5) and fellows in Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery and in Minimally Invasive Gynecologic Surgery (n = 10). The experts performed significantly better than the trainees in total score and in every domain of the Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills scale (median [range] score: expert group, 33 [30.5-39] vs. trainee group, 20.5 [13.5-30.5]; p = .002). Previous surgical experience had a strong association with performance on the model (rho > 0.75). Most subjects \"agreed\" or \"strongly agreed\" that the model was authentic to the live procedure and a useful training tool. There was strong agreement between masked raters (interclass correlation coefficient 0.84). CONCLUSION: This simulation model is valid and reliable for assessing performance of laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy and may be used for practicing key steps of the procedure.",

        "abstract": "We describe the presentation, diagnosis, and management of ureterovaginal fistula over a 7-year period at a tertiary care center.A retrospective review of ureterovaginal fistula cases between 2003 and 2011 was performed. Demographic information, antecedent event, symptoms, diagnostic modalities, and management strategies were reviewed.Nineteen ureterovaginal fistulas were identified during the 7-year study period. One fistula followed a repeat cesarean section and 18 fistulas followed a hysterectomy (9 total abdominal, 6 total laparoscopic, 3 vaginal hysterectomies). Ureteral injuries were not recognized in any of the patients at the time of index surgery. Computed tomography (CT) urography was the most commonly utilized diagnostic modality (58%). Primary non-surgical management with ureteral stents was attempted and successful in 5 out of 7 cases (71%). There were 14 total surgical repairs, including 2 cases in which stents were successfully placed, but the fistula persisted, and 6 additional cases where attempted stent placement failed. Surgical repair consisted of 10 ureteroneocystostomies performed via laparotomy and 4 performed laparoscopically, 3 of which were robotically assisted.Despite being uncommon, ureterovaginal fistula should remain in the differential diagnosis of new post-operative urinary incontinence after gynecological surgery. Conservative management with ureteral stent appears to be the best initial approach in selected patients, with a success rate of 71%. Minimally invasive approaches to performing ureteroneocystostomy have high success rates, comparable to those of open surgical repair.",

While the true prevalence of fecal incontinence is difficult to discern, it is estimated that almost 9 % of non-institutionalized women in the US experience this condition. Disorders leading to fecal urgency alone are usually related to rectal storage abnormalities while incontinence is often a result of anatomic or neurologic disruption of the anal sphincter complex. Many risk factors exist for fecal incontinence and include female sex, increasing age, higher body mass index (BMI), limited physical activity, smoking, presence of neuropsychiatric conditions, higher vaginal parity and history of obstetrical trauma, presence of chronic diarrhea and irritable bowel syndrome, or history of rectal surgery, prostatectomy and radiation. Evaluation of fecal incontinence involves a careful patient history and focused physical exam. Diagnostic tests include endorectal ultrasonography, anal manometry, anal sphincter electromyography, and defecography. Treatment strategies include behavioral, medical and surgical therapies as well as neuromodulation. Treatment is based on the presumed etiology of the condition and a multi-modal approach is often necessary to achieve the maximum benefit for patients.",

De novo SUI was determined by Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory responses through 12 months postoperatively. After fitting the multivariable logistic regression model using the best predictors, the model was internally validated with 1,000 bootstrap samples to obtain bias-corrected accuracy using a concordance index. The model's predictions were also externally validated by comparing findings against actual outcomes using Colpopexy and Urinary Reduction Efforts trial patients (n=316). The final model's performance was compared with experts using a test data set of 32 randomly chosen Outcomes Following Vaginal Prolapse Repair and Midurethral Sling trial patients through comparison of the model's area under the curve against: 1) 22 experts' predictions; and 2) preoperative prolapse reduction stress testing.A model containing seven predictors discriminated between de novo SUI status (concordance index 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65-0.80) in Outcomes Following Vaginal Prolapse Repair and Midurethral Sling participants and outperformed expert clinicians (area under the curve 0.72 compared with 0.62, P<.001) and preoperative urinary stress testing (area under the curve 0.72 compared with 0.54, P<.001). The concordance index for Colpopexy and Urinary Reduction Efforts trial participants was 0.62 (95% CI 0.56-0.69).This individualized prediction model for de novo SUI after vaginal POP surgery is valid and outperforms preoperative stress testing, prediction by experts, and preoperative reduction cough stress testing.

Face validity was measured using questions related to surgical authenticity and educational value of the model. Construct validity was measured by comparing scores using Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills Scale (GOALS) scale between \"procedure experts,\" \"robotic experts,\" and \"trainees\" groups. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare differences in the scores and operating times between the 3 groups. Associations between previous surgical experience and performance scores were measured using the Spearman rho correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Four urologists experienced with robotically assisted ureteroneocystostomies were included in the procedure experts group. The robotic experts group consisted of 5 gynecologists experienced in robotic surgery. The trainees group consisted of 12 urology and gynecology upper-level residents and fellows. All experts agreed or strongly agreed that the model was authentic to the live procedure and a useful training tool. Mean (SD) total GOALS scores were significantly better for the procedure experts group compared to the robotic experts group and to the trainees group (P=0.02 vs P=0.004, respectively). The robotic experts group's GOALS scores were also significantly higher than that of the trainees group (P=0.05). There were no differences in mean times required to complete the procedure. Surgical experience moderately correlated with scores on all 3 assessment scales. CONCLUSIONS: Superior performance on the model by more experienced surgeons demonstrates evidence of construct validity. This authentic and useful model allows surgeons to learn and practice the ureteral anastomosis portion of the ureteral reimplantation surgeries before operating on a live patient.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Milestone Project mandates programmes to assess the attainment of training outcomes, including the psychomotor (surgical or procedural) skills of medical trainees. The objectives of this study were to determine which tools exist to directly assess psychomotor skills in medical trainees on live patients and to identify the data indicating their psychometric and edumetric properties. METHODS: An electronic search was conducted for papers published from January 1948 to May 2011 using the PubMed, Education Resource Information Center (ERIC), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Web of Science electronic databases and the review of references in article bibliographies. A study was included if it described a tool or instrument designed for the direct observation of psychomotor skills in patient care settings by supervisors. Studies were excluded if they referred to tools that assessed only clinical or non-technical skills, involved non-medical health professionals, or assessed skills performed on a simulator. Overall, 4114 citations were screened, 168 (4.1%) articles were reviewed for eligibility and 51 (1.2%) manuscripts were identified as meeting the study inclusion criteria. Three authors abstracted and reviewed studies using a standardised form for the presence of key psychometric and edumetric elements as per ACGME and American Psychological Association (APA) recommendations, and also assigned an overall grade based on the ACGME Committee on Educational Outcome Assessment grading system. RESULTS: A total of 30 tools were identified. Construct validity based on associations between scores and training level was identified in 24 tools, internal consistency in 14, test-retest reliability in five and inter-rater reliability in 20. The modification of attitudes, knowledge or skills was reported using five tools. The seven-item Global Rating Scale and the Procedure-Based Assessment received an overall Class 1 ACGME grade and are recommended based on Level A ACGME evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous tools are available for the assessment of psychomotor skills in medical trainees, but evidence supporting their psychometric and edumetric properties is limited.",

        "abstract": "First-line conservative treatment for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) in women is behavioral intervention, including pelvic-floor muscle (PFM) exercise and bladder control strategies.The purposes of this study were: (1) to describe adherence and barriers to exercise and bladder control strategy adherence and (2) to identify predictors of exercise adherence.This study was a planned secondary analysis of data from a multisite, randomized trial comparing intravaginal continence pessary, multicomponent behavioral therapy, and combined therapy in women with stress-predominant urinary incontinence (UI).Data were analyzed from the groups who received behavioral intervention alone (n=146) or combined with continence pessary therapy (n=150). Adherence was measured during supervised treatment and at 3, 6, and 12 months post-randomization. Barriers to adherence were surveyed during treatment and at the 3-month time point. Regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of exercise adherence during supervised treatment and at the 3- and 12-month time points.During supervised treatment, ≥86% of the women exercised ≥5 days a week, and ≥80% performed at least 30 contractions on days they exercised. At 3, 6, and 12 months post-randomization, 95%, 88%, and 80% of women, respectively, indicated they were still performing PFM exercises. During supervised treatment and at 3 months post-randomization, ≥87% of the women reported using learned bladder control strategies to prevent SUI. In addition, the majority endorsed at least one barrier to PFM exercise, most commonly \"trouble remembering to do exercises.\" Predictors of exercise adherence changed over time. During supervised intervention, less frequent baseline UI and higher baseline 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) mental scores predicted exercise adherence. At 3 months post-randomization, women who dropped out of the study had weaker PFMs at baseline. At 12 months post-randomization, only \"trouble remembering\" was associated with exercise adherence.Adherence and barrier questionnaires were not validated.Adherence to PFM exercises and bladder control strategies for SUI can be high and sustained over time. However, behavioral interventions to help women link exercise to environmental and behavioral cues may only be beneficial over the short term.",

STUDY DESIGN: This study was a blinded, prospective randomized controlled trial conducted at 2 institutions. Subjects consisted of women who planned laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign indications. Preoperative randomization to total laparoscopic hysterectomy or robotic-assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy was stratified by surgeon and uterine size (> or ≤12 weeks). Validated questionnaires, activity assessment scales, and visual analogue scales were administered at baseline and during follow-up evaluation. RESULTS: Sixty-two women gave consent and were enrolled and randomly assigned; 53 women underwent surgery (laparoscopic, 27 women; robot-assisted, 26 women). There were no demographic differences between groups. Compared with laparoscopic hysterectomy, total case time (skin incision to skin closure) was significantly longer in the robot-assisted group (mean difference, +77 minutes; 95% confidence interval, 33-121; P < .001] as was total operating room time (entry into operating room to exit; mean difference, +72 minutes; 95% confidence interval, 14-130; P = .016). Mean docking time was 6 ± 4 minutes. There were no significant differences between groups in estimated blood loss, pre- and postoperative hematocrit change, and length of stay. There were very few complications, with no difference in individual complication types or total complications between groups. Postoperative pain and return to daily activities were no different between groups. CONCLUSION: Although laparoscopic and robotic-assisted hysterectomies are safe approaches to hysterectomy, robotic-assisted hysterectomy requires a significantly longer operative time.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop and internally validate a nomogram that facilitates decision making between patient and physician by predicting a woman's individual probability of developing urinary (UI) or fecal incontinence (FI) after her first delivery. METHODS: This study used Childbirth and Pelvic Symptoms Study data, which estimated the prevalence of postpartum UI and FI in primiparous women after vaginal or cesarean delivery. Two models were developed using antepartum variables, and 2 models were developed using antepartum plus labor and delivery variables. Urinary incontinence was defined by a response of leaking urine \"sometimes\" or \"often\" using the Medical, Epidemiological, and Social Aspects of Aging Questionnaire. Fecal incontinence was defined as any involuntary leakage of mucus, liquid, or solid stool using the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index. Logistic regression models allowing nonlinear effects were used and displayed as nomograms. Overall performance was assessed using the Brier score (zero equals perfect model) and concordance index (c-statistic). RESULTS: A total of 921 women enrolled in the Childbirth and Pelvic Symptoms Study, and 759 (82%) were interviewed by telephone 6 months postpartum. Two antepartum models were generated, which discriminated between women who will and will not develop UI (Brier score = 0.19, c-statistic = 0.69) and FI (Brier score = 0.10, c-statistic = 0.67) at 6 months and 2 models were generated (Brier score = 0.18, c-statistic= 0.68 and Brier score = 0.09, c-statistic = 0.68) for predicting UI and FI, respectively, for use after labor and delivery. CONCLUSIONS: These models yielded 4 nomograms that are accurate for generating individualized prognostic estimates of postpartum UI and FI and may facilitate decision making in the prevention of incontinence.",

RESULTS: One hundred women with an intact uterus responded. Sixty percent indicated they would decline hysterectomy if presented with an equally efficacious alternative to a hysterectomy-based prolapse repair. The doctor's opinion, risk of surgical complications, and risk of malignancy were the most important factors in surgical decision making. CONCLUSIONS: Many women with prolapse prefer to retain their uterus at the time of surgery in the absence of a substantial benefit to hysterectomy. These findings should provide further impetus to investigate the efficacy of uterine-sparing procedures to help women make informed decisions regarding prolapse surgery.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of a single-incision mini-sling, placed in the \"U\" position, with tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) in the treatment of stress urinary incontinence. METHODS: Women with urodynamic stress incontinence with or without genital prolapse were randomized to receive a mini-sling or TVT (N=263). Those randomized to the mini-sling received two \"sham\" suprapubic incisions to facilitate blinding. The primary outcome was subjective cure (absence of any urinary incontinence or retreatment) as assessed at 1 year. This trial was a noninferiority study design. RESULTS: Participants receiving the mini-sling were less likely to have a bladder injury (0.8% compared with 4.8%; P=.0.46), more likely to be discharged without a catheter (78.5% compared with 63%; P=.008), and had less pain for postoperative days 1-3. One year after surgery, the rate of cure was similar between treatment groups (mini-sling 55.8% compared with TVT 60.6%; mean difference, 4.8%; 95% confidence interval, -16.7 to +7.2); however, this did not meet our predefined noninferiority criteria of -12%. Incontinence severity at 1 year was greater with the mini-sling than with TVT (mean severity score ± SD: 2.2±2.7 compared with 1.5±1.9; P=.015), resulting predominantly from a higher proportion of participants with \"severe\" incontinence postoperatively (16% compared with 5%; P=.025). CONCLUSION: The mini-sling placed in the \"U\" position results in similar subjective cure rates to TVT 1 year after surgery but postoperative incontinence severity is greater with the mini-sling than with TVT.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: We determined the genetic contribution of and associated factors for bladder pain syndrome using an identical twin model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multiple questionnaires were administered to adult identical twin sister pairs. The O'Leary-Sant Interstitial Cystitis Symptom and Problem Index was administered to identify individuals at risk for bladder pain syndrome. Potential associated factors were modeled against the bladder pain syndrome score with the twin pair as a random effect of the factor on the bladder pain syndrome score. Variables that showed a significant relationship with the bladder pain syndrome score were entered into a multivariable model. RESULTS: In this study 246 identical twin sister pairs (total 492) participated with a mean age (± SD) of 40.3 ± 17 years. Of these women 45 (9%) were identified as having a moderate or high risk of bladder pain syndrome (index score greater than 13). There were 5 twin sets (2%) in which both twins met the criteria. Correlation of bladder pain syndrome scores within twin pairs was estimated at 0.35, suggesting a genetic contribution to bladder pain syndrome. Multivariable analysis revealed that increasing age (estimate 0.46 [95% CI 0.2, 0.7]), irritable bowel syndrome (1.8 [0.6, 3.7]), physical abuse (2.5 [0.5, 4.1]), frequent headaches (1.6 [0.6, 2.8]), multiple drug allergies (1.5 [0.5, 2.7]) and number of self-reported urinary tract infections in the last year (8.2 [4.7, 10.9]) were significantly associated with bladder pain syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Bladder pain syndrome scores within twin pairs were moderately correlated, implying some genetic component. Increasing age, irritable bowel syndrome, frequent headaches, drug allergies, self-reported urinary tract infections and physical abuse were factors associated with higher bladder pain syndrome scores.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare conventional laparoscopic and robotic-assisted laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy for vaginal apex prolapse. METHODS: This single-center, blinded randomized trial included participants with stage 2-4 posthysterectomy vaginal prolapse. Participants were randomized to laparoscopic or robotic sacrocolpopexy. The primary outcome was total operative time from incision to closure. Secondary outcomes were postoperative pain, functional activity, bowel and bladder symptoms, quality of life, anatomic vaginal support, and cost from a health care system perspective. RESULTS: A total of 78 patients enrolled and were randomized (laparoscopic n=38; robotic n=40). Total operative time was significantly longer in the robotic group compared with the laparoscopic group (+67-minute difference; 95% confidence interval [CI] 43-89; P<.001). Anesthesia time, total time in the operating room, total sacrocolpopexy time, and total suturing time were all significantly longer in the robotic group. Participants in the robotic group also had significantly higher pain at rest and with activity during weeks 3 through 5 after surgery and required longer use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (median, 20 compared with 11 days, P<.005). The robotic group incurred greater cost than the laparoscopic group (mean difference +$1,936; 95% CI $417-$3,454; P=.008). Both groups demonstrated significant improvement in vaginal support and functional outcomes 1 year after surgery with no differences between groups. CONCLUSION: Robotic-assisted sacrocolpopexy results in longer operating time and increased pain and cost compared with the conventional laparoscopic approach.",

RESULTS: Women with POP were more likely to experience lower abdominal or pelvic pain that was significantly bothersome and interfered with daily activities (odds ratio [OR], 9.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.7-20.4). After controlling for confounders, women with prolapse were more likely to report pressure in the lower abdomen (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.6-3.2), heaviness in the pelvic region (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.3-4.3), and pain in the lower abdomen (OR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.8-4.1).

STUDY DESIGN: This was a multicenter prospective study involving 5 obstetrics and gynecology residency programs. Surgeons from each site generated case scenarios based on common gynecologic procedures. Construct validity was evaluated by correlating scores to training level, in-service examinations, and surgical skill and experience using a Global Rating Scale of Operative Performance and case volumes. RESULTS: A final test that included 42 case scenarios was administered to 75 residents. Internal consistency (Cronbach alpha = 0.73) and test-retest reliability (Lin correlation coefficient = 0.76) were good. There were significant differences between test scores and training levels (P = .002) and test scores correlated with in-service examination scores (r = 0.38; P = .001). There was no association between test scores and total number of cases or technical skills. CONCLUSION: The Script Concordance Test appears to be a reliable, valid assessment tool for intraoperative decision-making during gynecologic surgery.",

STUDY DESIGN: Trainees from 2 institutions were directly assessed in the operating room by supervising surgeons while performing a vaginal hysterectomy using the new Vaginal Surgical Skills Index, global rating scale, and visual analogue scale. Trainees were assessed again by the same surgeons 4 weeks after the live surgery and by a blinded outside reviewer using a videotape of the case. Internal consistency, interrater and intrarater reliability, and construct validity were evaluated. RESULTS: Two hundred twelve evaluations were analyzed on 76 surgeries from 27 trainees. There was good internal consistency, interrater, and intrarater reliability. Vaginal Surgical Skills Index scores correlated with global rating score and visual analog scale scores. Increasing Vaginal Surgical Skills Index scores significantly correlated with year of training and surgical volume with an estimated increase in score of 0.3 per hysterectomy performed. CONCLUSION: The Vaginal Surgical Skills Index is a feasible, reliable, and valid instrument to assess vaginal surgical skills.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine measurable differences in the perception of learning between junior and senior residents in the operating rooms of an obstetrics and gynecology (OBGYN) residency program. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Using a cross-sectional design, the Operating Room Educational Environment Measure (OREEM), a 40-item educational environment inventory, was administered to 28 OBGYN residents from 1 training program, who train at 3 hospital sites. The OREEM measures a trainee's perceptions of the teaching surgeon, learning opportunities, operating room atmosphere, and workload. The primary outcome was total OREEM scores and secondary outcomes were OREEM subscale scores, global impression of education, and internal consistency and validity of the OREEM scale. Group sample sizes of 10 and 10 achieved 80% power to detect a 10% difference between group mean OREEM scores +/- 10% with a significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: Twenty-four residents including 11 junior (postgraduate years 1 and 2) and 13 senior (postgraduate years 3 and 4) residents were included in the analysis. Total OREEM scores, learning opportunities, and workload/support subscale scores were significantly lower for junior residents compared with senior residents across all sites. Perceptions of learning at a multispecialty tertiary referral hospital were lower than the community and regional hospitals. This was secondary to complexity of cases, subspecialty fellows, and decreased opportunities to first-assist in the operating room. The OREEM demonstrated acceptable reliability and construct validity. CONCLUSIONS: There are measurable differences in perception of the operating room educational environment between junior and senior OBGYN residents using the reliable and valid Operating Room Educational Environment Measure.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to establish minimum cutoff scores on intraoperative assessments of surgical skills to determine surgical competence for vaginal hysterectomy. STUDY DESIGN: Two surgical rating scales, the Global Rating Scale of Operative Performance and the Vaginal Surgical Skills Index, were used to evaluate trainees while performing vaginal hysterectomy. Cutoff scores were determined using the Modified Angoff method. RESULTS: Two hundred twelve evaluations were analyzed on 76 surgeries performed by 27 trainees. Trainees were considered minimally competent to perform vaginal hysterectomy if total absolute scores (95% confidence interval) on Global Rating Scale = 18 (16.5-20.3) and Vaginal Surgical Skills Index = 32 (27.7-35.5). On average, trainees met new cutoffs after performing 21 and 27 vaginal hysterectomies, respectively. With the new cutoffs applied to the same cohort of fourth-year obstetrics and gynecology trainees, all residents achieved competency in performing vaginal hysterectomy by the end of their gynecology rotations. CONCLUSION: Standard-setting methods using cutoff scores may be used to establish competence in vaginal surgery.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: : To compare the relative frequencies of constipation and other functional bowel disorders between patients with and without pelvic organ prolapse (POP). METHODS: : This was a case-control study design. Cases were patients with stage 3-4 POP presenting to a urogynecology clinic and controls were patients presenting to a general gynecology or women's health clinic for annual examinations with stage 0-1 vaginal support. Constipation disorders were defined using responses to the Rome II Modular Questionnaire for functional bowel disorders as well as predefined defecatory disorders. RESULTS: : 128 cases and 127 controls were enrolled. After controlling for race, education, and comorbidities, women with POP were more likely to report symptoms consistent with outlet constipation, including straining during a bowel movement (odds ratio [OR] 3.9, confidence interval [CI] 2.1-7.3), feeling of incomplete rectal emptying (OR 4.0, CI 2.1-7.7), a sensation that stool cannot be passed (OR 3.4, CI 1.7-6.7), and splinting (OR 2.7, CI 1.3-5.7). In spite of this, cases were just as likely to meet the criteria for functional constipation or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with constipation as controls but more likely to meet the criteria for IBS-any type (OR 3.8, CI 1.6-9.1) as women with POP reported more discomfort or pain in the abdomen (OR 3.4 CI 1.6-7.1) and >3 bowel movements per day (OR 2.9, CI 1.3-6.3). CONCLUSIONS: : Patients with POP are more likely to have symptoms of outlet constipation and other functional bowel disorders compared with patients without POP. The Rome II criteria may not be an appropriate classification system for functional bowel disorders in patients with advanced POP.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether an endometrial thickness less than 5 mm on transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is sufficient to exclude benign endometrial lesions in postmenopausal women with bleeding and to determine a cutoff value below which benign endometrial pathology could be ruled out. METHODS: Electronic medical records of consecutive postmenopausal women presenting with vaginal bleeding suspicious for benign pathology were reviewed between September 2002 and December 2007. All women underwent TVUS with endometrial stripe measurement followed by saline infusion sonography (SIS). Accuracy of endometrial echo thickness for detecting intracavitary masses was compared with the reference standard of SIS. A receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed to calculate whether other cutoff values would be more accurate than 5 mm in detecting benign endometrial masses. RESULTS: A total of 1,097 women were referred during the study period; 135 met the inclusion criteria and underwent TVUS followed by SIS. The endometrial echo was less than 5 mm in 43% and 5 mm or greater in 57%. The overall prevalence of polyps or fibroids was 50%. Using an endometrial echo cutoff less than 5 mm, sensitivity was 76% (95% CI, 65-85), specificity was 63% (95% CI, 51-73), positive predictive value was 67%, and negative predictive value was 72%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for detection of benign masses was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.72-0.87). We were unable to determine a cutoff value below which benign endometrial pathology could be excluded. CONCLUSIONS: With an endometrial thickness cutoff of 5 mm a considerable amount of benign endometrial pathology in postmenopausal women with bleeding is missed, and SIS or hysteroscopy may be warranted.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the feasibility of using video motion analysis to quantitate a key step of vaginal hysterectomy and define measurable differences between novice and experienced surgical trainees during vaginal hysterectomy. METHODS: Analyses focused on clamping, transecting, and suturing the left uterosacral ligament. Using a cutoff of 25, trainees were grouped as experienced (n=14) and novice (n=9) based on the total number of vaginal hysterectomies performed by each trainee. Contrasting-groups analysis was used to determine cutoff values that separated novices from experts. RESULTS: Novice trainees took longer (112 seconds compared with 84 seconds) and had greater cumulative translational motion (92 cm compared with 49 cm, P=.05) while performing the task. Experienced trainees placed the Heaney clamp closer to a right angle to the vertical axis (experienced 96 degrees compared with novice 109 degrees , P=.03) while passing the needle through the uterosacral ligament. Trainees move from novice to experts when the steps occur in 112 or fewer seconds, cumulative translational motion is at or less than 75 cm, and the angle between the clamp to bladder retractor is at or below 105 degrees . CONCLUSION: Video motion analysis is a feasible technique to quantify and compare surgical skills objectively during vaginal surgery. There are measurable differences between novice and more experienced surgical trainees performing vaginal hysterectomy that can be quantified using motion analysis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.",

        "abstract": "To demonstrate the feasibility of using video motion analysis to quantitate a key step of vaginal hysterectomy and define measurable differences between novice and experienced surgical trainees during vaginal hysterectomy. Analyses focused on clamping, transecting, and suturing the left uterosacral ligament. Using a cutoff of 25, trainees were grouped as experienced (n=14) and novice (n=9) based on the total number of vaginal hysterectomies performed by each trainee. Contrasting-groups analysis was used to determine cutoff values that separated novices from experts. Novice trainees took longer (112 seconds compared with 84 seconds) and had greater cumulative translational motion (92 cm compared with 49 cm, P=.05) while performing the task. Experienced trainees placed the Heaney clamp closer to a right angle to the vertical axis (experienced 96° compared with novice 109°, P=.03) while passing the needle through the uterosacral ligament. Trainees move from novice to experts when the steps occur in 112 or fewer seconds, cumulative translational motion is at or less than 75 cm, and the angle between the clamp to bladder retractor is at or below 105°. Video motion analysis is a feasible technique to quantify and compare surgical skills objectively during vaginal surgery. There are measurable differences between novice and more experienced surgical trainees performing vaginal hysterectomy that can be quantified using motion analysis.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vaginal mesh kits are being used to surgically treat apical vaginal prolapse; however, their safety and efficacy are currently unknown. OBJECTIVES: To summarise success and complication rates for commonly used vaginal mesh kits in the treatment of apical prolapse. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE and other scientific databases were queried for primary research addressing the use of vaginal mesh kits for apical prolapse published between 1950 and 2007, including abstracts presented in major scientific meetings. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies describing the use of mesh to support either the anterior or posterior compartment alone, for incontinence or fistula repair or not addressing the vaginal apex were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Identified studies were grouped by the mesh kit and complications categorised using the Dindo classification system. Weighted averages and confidence intervals were calculated on objective success, follow-up length and complications. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty studies totalling 2653 women met inclusion criteria. Objective success rates (95% CI) were Apogee (American Medical Systems Inc., Minnetonka, MN, USA) 95% (95-96), Prolift (Ethicon Women's Health and Urology, Somerville, NJ, USA) 87% (86-87) and posterior intravaginal slingplasty 88% (87-89). Reoperations not requiring anaesthesia (Dindo IIIa) occurred in 0.4-2.3% and requiring anaesthesia (Dindo IIIb) in 1.5-6.0%, with a follow up between 26 and 78 weeks. Mesh erosion was the most commonly reported complication occurring in 4.6-10.7%. AUTHOR'S CONCLUSIONS: Overall objective success using transvaginal mesh kits in restoring apical vaginal prolapse is high. However, an increasing number of women require surgical intervention for mesh-related complications based on limited data quality and short follow up. Further research addressing functional outcomes and the impact of these procedures on women's symptoms and quality of life is mandatory.",

        "abstract": "Background: The primary aims of this trial are to determine whether the use of a concomitant prophylactic anti-incontinence procedure may prevent stress urinary incontinence symptom development in women undergoing vaginal prolapse surgery and to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this prophylactic approach. Purpose: To present the rationale and design of a randomized controlled surgical trial (RCT), the Outcomes following vaginal Prolapse repair and mid Urethral Sling (OPUS) Trial highlighting the challenges in the design and implementation. Methods: The challenges of implementing this surgical trial combined with a cost-effectiveness study and patient preference group are discussed including the study design, ethical issues regarding use of sham incision, maintaining the masking of study staff, and pragmatic difficulties encountered in the collection of cost data. The trial is conducted by the NICHD-funded Pelvic Floor Disorders Network. Results: The ongoing OPUS trial started enrollment in May 2007 with a planned accrual of 350. The use of sham incision was generally well accepted but the collection of cost data using conventional billing forms was found to potentially unmask key study personnel. This necessitated changes in the study forms and planned timing for collection of cost data. To date, the enrollment to the patient preference group has been lower than the limit established by the protocol suggesting a willingness on the part of women to participate in the randomization. Limitations: Given the invasive nature of surgical intervention trials, potential participants may be reluctant to accept random assignment, potentially impacting generalizability. Conclusion: Findings from the OPUS trial will provide important information that will help surgeons to better counsel women on the benefits and risks of concomitant prophylactic anti-incontinence procedure at the time of vaginal surgery for prolapse. The implementation of the OPUS trial has necessitated that investigators consider ethical issues up front, remain flexible with regards to data collection and be constantly aware of unanticipated opportunities for unmasking. Future surgical trials should be aware of potential challenges in maintaining masking and collection of cost-related information. © Society for Clinical Trials 2009.",

STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective review of all patients who underwent surgical removal of transvaginal mesh for mesh-related complications during a 3-year period at Cleveland Clinic. At last follow-up, patients reported degree of pain, level of improvement, sexual activity, and continued symptoms. RESULTS: Nineteen patients underwent removal of mesh during the study period. Indications for removal included chronic pain (6/19), dyspareunia (6/19), recurrent pelvic organ prolapse (8/19), mesh erosion (12/19), and vesicovaginal fistula (3/19), with most patients (16/19) citing more than 1 reason. There were few complications related to the mesh removal. Most patients reported significant relief of symptoms. CONCLUSION: Mesh removal can be technically difficult but appears to be safe with few complications and high relief of symptoms, although some symptoms can persist.",

STUDY DESIGN: Electronic medical records of all patients who underwent uterine artery embolization for symptomatic uterine leiomyomata were reviewed. Logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors for any surgical intervention and for hysterectomy alone after uterine artery embolization. RESULTS: Uterine artery embolization was performed in 454 patients during the study period, with a median follow-up time (range) of 14 (0-128) months. Overall, 99 patients (22%) underwent any surgical intervention after uterine artery embolization in the operating room. Risk factors for any surgical intervention included younger age (P < .003), bleeding as an indication for uterine artery embolization (P < .01), presence of significant collateral ovarian vessel contribution to the uterus (P < .01), or use of 355-500 mum particles (P < .008). CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing uterine artery embolization have a 22% risk for requiring additional surgical intervention, but overall uterine artery embolization is an effective minimally invasive option.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To review the first-year experience implementing a new early screening during pregnancy program for aneuploidy in a community hospital and compare this program with the screening program immediately preceding its implementation. METHODS: The electronic medical records of all pregnant patients referred from May 17, 2005, through December 31, 2006, for genetic counseling were reviewed for maternal characteristics, indication for referral, a priori and adjusted risk of aneuploidy, and patient choice for screening or testing. The new early screening program (nuchal translucency group) consisted of additional educational materials, nuchal translucency, serum biochemical analytes, quad screening, and invasive testing when indicated. This cohort was compared with the patients who received traditional genetic screening or testing (pre-nuchal translucency) immediately preceding the nuchal translucency program. RESULTS: A total of 101 patients were included in the pre-nuchal translucency group compared with 359 patients in the nuchal translucency group. The most common reason for referral was advanced maternal age; there were no differences in the maternal characteristics between the two groups. Forty-six percent of patients in the early screening program underwent an invasive procedure compared with 76% in the pre-nuchal translucency group (odds ratio 0.26, 95% confidence interval 0.15-0.42; P<.001). CONCLUSION: Early screening programs in a single community hospital are feasible and appear to result in a significant reduction in the number of invasive procedures with excellent patient satisfaction and acceptance.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To compare the long-term oncologic and renal function outcomes in patients undergoing laparoscopic (LRN) versus open radical nephrectomy (ORN). METHODS: The medical records of 116 patients undergoing radical nephrectomy for pathologically confirmed renal cell carcinoma before January 2000 were reviewed. Of these 116 patients, 63 underwent LRN and 53 ORN. The oncologic and renal functional data were obtained from the patient charts, radiographic reports, and direct telephone calls to the patients or their families. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 65 months (range 19 to 92) in the LRN group and 76 months (range 8 to 105) in the ORN group. LRN was successfully completed in all patients without open conversion. The mean tumor size was 5.4 cm in the LRN group and 6.4 cm in the ORN group (P = 0.007). The 5-year overall survival (78% versus 84%, respectively; P = 0.24), cancer-specific survival (91% versus 93%, respectively; P = 0.75), and recurrence-free survival (91% versus 93%, respectively; P = 0.75) rates were similar between the LRN and ORN groups. At 7 years, the overall survival (72% versus 84%; P = 0.24), cancer-specific survival (91% versus 93%; P = 0.75), and recurrence-free survival (91% versus 93%; P = 0.75) rates were also comparable. No port site recurrence was noted in the laparoscopic group. The long-term renal function outcomes were similar in the LRN and ORN groups, with serum creatinine increasing by 33% and 25%, and the estimated creatinine clearance decreasing by 31% and 23% from baseline, respectively. Chronic renal insufficiency developed in 4% of patients in each group. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study have shown that LRN and ORN have comparable long-term oncologic and renal functional outcomes.",

STUDY DESIGN: Seventy-five consecutive women suffering from a chronic VVD were recruited and classified using current International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease (ISSVD) classification criteria. They completed a 69-item, self-administered, comprehensive questionnaire to assess the impact of chronic VVD on psychosocial functioning and quality of life. Summary scores were calculated for 5 domains including pain, body image, relationships, emotion, quality of life and sexual function. RESULTS: After adjusting for age and duration of vulvovaginal symptoms, women with vulvodynia were more likely than women with other chronic VVDs to score significantly worse on relationship (p < 0.001), emotion (p < 0.03) and physical activity (p = 0.001) areas. The majority of subjects suffered from a worsening impact of sexual function, and no differences were detected between the groups. The overall intensity of vulvar or vaginal pain correlated weakly with the degree of psychosocial impairment in the domains of relationships, emotion and physical quality of life. CONCLUSION: Differences in quality of life exist between women with vulvodynia and those with other chronic VVDs. The presence, not the intensity, of vulvovaginal pain correlates with degree of psychosocial impairment.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term efficacy of laparoscopic Burch colposuspension with tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) for the treatment of urodynamic stress urinary incontinence (SUI). DESIGN: Long-term follow up from a prospective randomised trial. SETTING: Academic tertiary referral centre. SAMPLE: Seventy-two women with urodynamic SUI from two institutions. METHODS: Subjects were randomised to either laparoscopic Burch or TVT from August 1999 to August 2002. Follow-up evaluations occurred 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 4-8 years after surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subjects completed the Incontinence Severity Index, Urogenital Distress Inventory 6 (UDI-6), Incontinence Impact Questionnaire (IIQ-7), and Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) scales. RESULTS: Median follow-up duration was 65 months (range 12-88 months) with 92% completing at least one follow-up visit. Seventy-four percent of subjects had long-term (4-8 years) follow up. Fifty-eight percent of subjects receiving laparoscopic Burch compared with 48% of TVT subjects reported any urinary incontinence 4-8 years after surgery (Relative Risk (RR):1.19; 95% CI: 0.71-2.0) with no significant difference between groups. Bothersome SUI symptoms were seen in 11 and 8%, respectively, 4-8 years after surgery (P = 0.26). There was significant improvement in the postoperative UDI-6 and IIQ-7 scores in both groups at 1-2 years that were maintained throughout follow up with no significant differences between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: TVT has similar long-term efficacy to laparoscopic Burch for the treatment of SUI. A substantial proportion of subjects have some degree of urinary incontinence 4-8 years after surgery; however, the majority of incontinence is not bothersome.",

STUDY DESIGN: Four anterior transobturator and 2 posterior ischiorectal TVM trocars were inserted bilaterally into 8 fresh frozen cadavers. Dissections were performed and mean distances (95% confidence interval) were measured between the closest points along the trocar's path and significant anatomic structures. RESULTS: The mean distances between both anterior transobturator trocars and the medial branch of the obturator vessels were 0.8 cm (range, 0.6 to 1.0) and 0.7 cm (range, 0.4 to 1.1), and bladder were 0.7 cm (range, 0.5 to 0.9) and 1.3 cm (range, 0.8 to 1.9), respectively. The mean distances between the posterior trocar and the rectum and inferior rectal vessels were 0.8 cm (range, 0.6 to 1.0) and 0.9 cm (range, 0.7 to 1.1), respectively. CONCLUSION: The bladder and medial branch of the obturator vessel may be at risk of injury during the passage of the anterior trocars, whereas the rectum and inferior rectal vessels may be at risk during the passage of the posterior trocar.",

Subjects undergoing laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy, supracervical hysterectomy, or hysterectomy for malignancy were excluded. Intraoperative cystoscopy with intravenous indigo carmine was routinely performed. Relevant data were abstracted to determine the incidence of lower urinary tract injury, predictors of injury, and postoperative complications.Total laparoscopic hysterectomy was performed in 126 consecutive subjects. Two (1.6%) cystotomies were noted and repaired before cystoscopy was performed. Two (1.6%) additional cystotomies were detected during cystoscopy. Absent ureteral spill of indigo carmine was detected in 2 subjects: 1 (0.8%) with previously unknown renal disease and 1 (0.8%) with ureteral obstruction that was relieved with subsequent suture removal. Only 40% (2/5) of injuries were recognized without the use of cystoscopy with indigo carmine. The overall incidence of injury to the lower urinary tract was 4.0%. No subjects required postoperative intervention to the lower urinary tract within the 6-week perioperative period. Performing a ureterolysis was associated with an increased rate (odds ratio 8.7, 95%CI, 1.2-170, P=0.024) of lower urinary tract injury.Surgeons should consider performing cystoscopy with intravenous indigo carmine dye at the time of total laparoscopic hysterectomy.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: We determined the incidence of and risk factors for perioperative complications associated with laparoscopic oncological surgery for urological malignancy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All records of patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for urological malignancy at a tertiary care institution from April 1997 through January 2006 were reviewed. Relevant demographic and perioperative data during and within 6 weeks of surgery were evaluated retrospectively. Various factors were analyzed to estimate risk of a perioperative complication such as the Charlson Comorbidity Index, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, European Scoring System for laparoscopic urological operations and surgeon experience. Logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors for perioperative complications. RESULTS: A total of 1,867 laparoscopic oncological surgeries were performed, including radical or partial nephrectomy, nephroureterectomy, radical prostatectomy and radical cystectomy. Perioperative complications occurred in 12.4% of patients, including 3.5% intraoperatively and 8.9% postoperatively. Intraoperative (2.3%) and postoperative hemorrhage (2.7%) accounted for 40% of all perioperative complications. All cause perioperative mortality occurred in 8 patients (0.4%). On multivariate analysis radical cystectomy (adjusted OR 4.9, p <0.001), partial nephrectomy (adjusted OR 2.4, p <0.001), length of surgery greater than 4 hours (adjusted OR 2.5, p <0.001) and preoperative serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dl (adjusted OR 2.1, p = 0.04) were independent risk factors for perioperative complications. Comparing the periods of 1997 to 2000 vs 2001 to 2005, despite a significant increase in technical complexity of procedures (European Scoring System 9.8 vs 60.6, p <0.001), the incidence of complications tended to decrease (17.3% vs 12.5%, p = 0.3). CONCLUSIONS: In appropriately selected patients laparoscopic urological oncological surgery is safe. These data on perioperative complications could possibly serve as a reference benchmark for practicing urologists.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyze change in bowel function and its relationship to vaginal anatomy 1 year after rectocele repair and pelvic reconstruction in a randomized trial of 3 techniques of rectocele repair. STUDY DESIGN: The study is an ancillary analysis of data from a randomized trial of 3 techniques of rectocele repair: posterior colporrhaphy, site-specific repair, and site-specific repair with Fortagen graft augmentation. Pelvic examination and validated questionnaires were obtained at baseline, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery. Bowel symptoms included straining, splinting, incomplete emptying, painful defecation, fecal urgency, and fecal incontinence. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of bothersome postoperative symptoms. RESULTS: One hundred six women with Stage > or = 2 POP, which included a rectocele, were enrolled in the study. Ninety-nine underwent prolapse surgery that included a rectocele repair and completed at least 1 follow-up visit. Ninety-six percent of subjects underwent concomitant prolapse surgery. No differences in change in bowel symptoms were noted between treatment groups. On average, all bowel symptoms evaluated were significantly improved 1 year after surgery. The development of new \"bothersome\" bowel symptoms after surgery was uncommon (11%). After controlling for age, treatment group, comorbidities, and preoperative bowel symptoms, corrected postoperative vaginal support (Stage 0/1) was associated with a reduced risk of postoperative straining (adj. OR 0.17 95% CI 0.03 to 0.9) and feeling of incomplete emptying (adj. OR 0.1 95% CI 0.01 to 0.52). Normal support of the posterior vaginal wall (Bp < or = -2) was associated with a reduced risk of bothersome incomplete emptying (OR 0.08 95% CI 0.004 to 0.58) but not with other symptoms. CONCLUSION: Resolution or improvement in bowel symptoms can be expected in the majority of women after rectocele repair and pelvic reconstruction. While all symptoms improved after surgery, a reduction in bothersome postoperative straining and incomplete emptying were specifically associated with cure of posterior vaginal wall prolapse.",

        "abstract": "Pelvic organ prolapse is downward descent of female pelvic organs, including the bladder, uterus or post-hysterectomy vaginal cuff, and the small or large bowel, resulting in protrusion of the vagina, uterus, or both. Prolapse development is multifactorial, with vaginal child birth, advancing age, and increasing body-mass index as the most consistent risk factors. Vaginal delivery, hysterectomy, chronic straining, normal ageing, and abnormalities of connective tissue or connective-tissue repair predispose some women to disruption, stretching, or dysfunction of the levator ani complex, connective-tissue attachments of the vagina, or both, resulting in prolapse. Patients generally present with several complaints, including bladder, bowel, and pelvic symptoms; however, with the exception of vaginal bulging, none is specific to prolapse. Women with symptoms suggestive of prolapse should undergo a pelvic examination and medical history check. Radiographic assessment is usually unnecessary. Many women with pelvic organ prolapse are asymptomatic and do not need treatment. When prolapse is symptomatic, options include observation, pessary use, and surgery. Surgical strategies for prolapse can be categorised broadly by reconstructive and obliterative techniques. Reconstructive procedures can be done by either an abdominal or vaginal approach. Although no effective prevention strategy for prolapse has been identified, considerations include weight loss, reduction of heavy lifting, treatment of constipation, modification or reduction of obstetric risk factors, and pelvic-floor physical therapy.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine accuracy of the 7-8-9 Rule in a cohort of neonates. STUDY DESIGN: This study was cross-sectional in design. Seventy-five consecutive neonates who required oral intubation from June 2004 to November 2004 for cardiopulmonary failure, respiratory distress, or surfactant administration were the subjects of this study. The initial endotracheal tube (ETT) depth of insertion was determined using either an estimated birth weight or actual weight in the 7-8-9 Rule calculation followed by auscultation and subsequent adjustment if necessary. Midtracheal position was identified as the point halfway between the inferior clavicle and carina on a chest radiograph. The initial depth was compared to the midtracheal depth to determine clinical accuracy of the 7-8-9 Rule. The depth predicted by the 7-8-9 Rule was also calculated using only actual weights. This predicted depth was compared to the midtracheal depth to determine true accuracy of the 7-8-9 Rule. Accuracy was determined using mean paired differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI) between initial or predicted depth and ideal, midtracheal ETT depth. Linear regression was used to adjust for confounding variables. RESULTS: Mean (range) gestational age was 32 weeks (23 to 44 weeks) and weight was 2001 g (490 to 4400 g). Eighteen (24%) infants weighed 1000 g or less, 20 (27%) weighed between 1001 and 2000 g, 21 (28%) weighed between 2001 and 3000 g, 15 (20%) weighed between 3001 and 4000 g, and one (1%) weighed more than 4000 g. Thirteen of the 18 extremely low birth weight infants weighed <750 g. The initial depth of insertion was 0.004 cm above midtracheal position (95% CI -0.13 to 0.14, P = 0.96). After controlling for head position, the initial depth did not significantly differ from the midtracheal position among weight groups. Predicted depth using the 7-8-9 Rule placed the ETT 0.12 cm above midtracheal position (95% CI -0.30 to 0.06, P = 0.20). However, after controlling for head position, the 7-8-9 Rule positioned the ETT significantly below midtracheal position in infants weighing <750 g (mean 0.62 cm; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.93, P=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The 7-8-9 Rule appears to be an accurate clinical method for endotracheal tube placement in neonates weighing more than 750 g. When the 7-8-9 Rule is applied to infants weighing <750 g, caution is warranted. The current rule may lead to an overestimated depth of insertion and potentially result in clinically significant consequences.",

STUDY DESIGN: The study was a retrospective review of 700 consecutive patients who underwent vaginal surgery for anterior and/or apical pelvic organ prolapse with universal intraoperative cystoscopy. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients (5.3%) had no spillage of dye from 1 or both ureters intraoperatively. The false-positive and negative cystoscopy rates were 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Thus, the true incidence of intraoperative ureteral obstruction was 5.1%. Intraoperative cystoscopy was accurate in 99.3% of cases, with a sensitivity and specificity of 94.4% and 99.5%, respectively. Suture removal relieved ureteral obstruction in 88% of cases. Six subjects (0.9%) had true ureteral injuries. CONCLUSION: Vaginal surgery for anterior and/or apical pelvic organ prolapse is associated with an intraoperative ureteral obstruction rate of 5.1%. Intraoperative cystoscopy accurately detects ureteral obstruction and allows for relief of obstruction in the majority of cases.",

Body image has been shown to be an important component of differences in quality of life. To date, there are no data on body image in patients with advanced pelvic organ prolapse. Our objective was to compare body image and quality of life in women with advanced pelvic organ prolapse with normal controls. STUDY DESIGN: We used a case-control study design. Cases were defined as subjects who presented to a tertiary urogynecology clinic with advanced pelvic organ prolapse (stage 3 or 4). Controls were defined as subjects who presented to a tertiary care gynecology or women's health clinic for an annual visit with normal pelvic floor support (stage 0 or 1) and without urinary incontinence. All patients completed a valid and reliable body image scale and a generalized (Short Form Health Survey) and condition-specific (Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-20) quality-of-life scale. Linear and logistic regression analyses were performed to adjust for possible confounding variables. RESULTS: Forty-seven case and 51 control subjects were enrolled. After controlling for age, race, parity, previous hysterectomy, and medical comorbidities, subjects with advanced pelvic organ prolapse were more likely to feel self-conscious (adjusted odds ratio 4.7; 95% confidence interval 1.4 to 18, P = .02), less likely to feel physically attractive (adjusted odds ratio 11; 95% confidence interval 2.9 to 51, P < .001), less likely to feel feminine (adjusted odds ratio 4.0; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 15, P = .03), and less likely to feel sexually attractive (adjusted odds ratio 4.6; 95% confidence interval 1.4 to 17, P = .02) than normal controls. The groups were similar in their feeling of dissatisfaction with appearance when dressed, difficulty looking at themselves naked, avoiding people because of appearance, and overall dissatisfaction with their body. Subjects with advanced pelvic organ prolapse suffered significantly lower quality of life on the physical scale of the SF-12 (mean 42; 95% confidence interval 39 to 45 versus mean 50; 95% confidence interval 47 to 53, P < .009). However, no differences between groups were noted on the mental scale of the SF-12 (mean 51; 95% confidence interval 50 to 54 versus mean 50; 95% confidence interval 47 to 52, P = .56). Additionally, subjects with advanced pelvic organ prolapse scored significantly worse on the prolapse, urinary, and colorectal scales and overall summary score of Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-20 than normal controls (mean summary score 104; 95% confidence interval 90 to 118 versus mean 29; 95% confidence interval 16 to 43, P < .0001), indicating a decrease in condition-specific quality of life. Worsening body image correlated with lower quality of life on both the physical and mental scales of the SF-12 as well as the prolapse, urinary, and colorectal scales and overall summary score of Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-20 in subjects with advanced pelvic organ prolapse. CONCLUSION: Women seeking treatment for advanced pelvic organ prolapse have decreased body image and overall quality of life. Body image may be a key determinant for quality of life in patients with advanced prolapse and may be an important outcome measure for treatment evaluation in clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was 1) to determine the prevalence of functional bowel and anorectal disorders as defined by the Rome II criteria in patients with advanced pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and urinary incontinence (UI), and (2) to determine if the extent of prolapse on gynecologic examination is related to the subtypes of constipation or any functional anorectal pain disorder. STUDY DESIGN: Three hundred and two consecutive female subjects presenting to a tertiary urogynecology clinic were enrolled. Demographic, general medical, and physical examination information, including POPQ measurements and a standardized sacral neurologic evaluation, were collected. The prevalence of functional disorders of the bowel, rectum, and anus as defined by the Rome II criteria were collected using the Rome II Modular questionnaire. Relationships of functional disorders to various components of the vaginal examination were reviewed. RESULTS: Thirty-six percent (108/302) met the criteria for constipation, including the following subtypes: 19% outlet constipation, 5% functional constipation, 5% constipation predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and 7% IBS-outlet. Nineteen percent (56/302) of subjects had IBS or 1 of its subtypes. Functional diarrhea was seen in 6% (17/302), fecal incontinence in 19% (58/302), and anorectal pain disorders in 25% (77/302). After controlling for age, parity, diabetes, constipating medications, and previous pelvic surgery, there were no differences in the prevalence of constipation or any of its subtypes between patients with UI and those with stage 3 or 4 POP. Fecal incontinence was independently associated with UI (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 6.3; 95% CI 2.6-19.1), but not advanced POP. Neither overall stage of POP nor stage of posterior vaginal prolapse was significantly associated with any of the functional bowel disorders, including constipation and its subtypes. Perineal body measurement was significantly longer in patients with outlet type constipation (mean 3.5 +/- 0.6 cm vs 3.1 +/- 0.9 cm, P < .01) and in those with proctalgia fugax (mean 3.4 +/- 1.0 vs 3.1 +/- 0.8, P < .05). CONCLUSION: There is a high prevalence of constipation and anorectal pain disorders in women with urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. However, patients with stage 3 or 4 pelvic organ prolapse have similar rates of constipation compared with those with urinary incontinence. Constipation and its subtypes are not related to the stage of pelvic organ prolapse. It appears that either constipation is not a significant contributor to prolapse, or constipation contributes equally to the development of both urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the distances of the major bony, vascular, neurologic, and visceral structures to the path of the infracoccygeal sacropexy trocar and to determine the point of trocar entry into the vagina. STUDY DESIGN: Infracoccygeal sacropexy trocars were inserted bilaterally into 6 fresh frozen cadavers. Dissection was performed and the maximal length of the vagina, ischiorectal fossa, and pararectal spaces were measured bilaterally. Mean distances with 95% CIs to important anatomic structures were made from fixed points along the trocar's path. RESULTS: The path of the trocar began dorsal and lateral to the anus, passed through the ischiorectal fossa, iliococcygeus muscle, into the pararectal space, and into the posteriolateral vagina. Along this course, the mean distance (95% CI) to the pudendal vessels at the exit of Alcock's canal was 2.8 cm (2.1 to 3.4 cm) and rectum was 0.5 cm (0.2 to 0.9 cm). The closest inferior rectal vessel was 0.1 cm (0 to 0.3 cm). In the pararectal space, the mean distance to the ischial spine was 2.6 cm (1.7 to 3.5 cm). In 12 of 12 trocar passages, the inferior rectal branches of the pudendal artery and the rectum were within 1 cm or less of the trocar. The mean distance of trocar entry into the vagina was only 4.8 cm (4.3 to 5.4 cm) proximal to the hymenal ring compared with a mean total vaginal length of 8.7 cm (8.0 to 9.3 cm). CONCLUSION: This anatomic study suggests that the rectum and the inferior rectal branches of the pudendal neurovascular bundle may be at risk of injury during infracoccygeal sacropexy trocar placement. Additionally, this procedure appears to provide support to the mid-posterior vaginal wall, not the vaginal apex.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to describe the time to adequate voiding, incidence of urinary retention, and predictors of voiding efficiency and urinary retention after tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) with and without concurrent prolapse surgery. STUDY DESIGN: Medical records of patients who underwent TVT between August 1999 and July 2003 were reviewed. Urinary retention was defined as the need for urethrolysis, urethral dilation, or postoperative catheterization for >6 weeks. Linear and logistic regression models were used to determine predictors of time to adequate voiding and urinary retention. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-seven patients were available for analysis; 66% had concurrent prolapse repair, 4% had concurrent laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH), and 30% had an isolated TVT. TVT with and without concurrent prolapse repair or LAVH were statistically similar with respect to median days to voiding (8 vs 5) and the rate of urinary retention (11.2% vs 11.3%). Overall, 4.9% underwent urethrolysis, 1.9% received urethral dilation, and 4.1% required prolonged catheterization. Increasing age, decreasing BMI, and postoperative urinary tract infection were independent predictors of time to adequate voiding. Previous history of incontinence surgery was the only independent predictor of urinary retention (Adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.96, 95%CI [1.17-7.06]). CONCLUSION: Concurrent prolapse surgery does not appear to significantly alter postoperative voiding efficiency or increase the risk of prolonged urinary retention compared with TVT alone.",

    "overview": "<p>Dr. Jelovsek is the Vice Chair of Education and the Director of Data Science for Women&rsquo;s Health in Department of Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology (OBGYN) at Duke University. He is Board Certified in OBGYN by the American Board of OBGYN and Board Certified in Female Pelvic Medicine &amp; Reconstructive Surgery by the American Board of OBGYN and American Board of Urology. He currently practices Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery (FPMRS). He has expertise in the development and validation of &ldquo;individualized&rdquo; patient-centered prediction tools to improve patient and clinician decision-making around development and possible prevention of pelvic floor disorders after childbirth, predicting the risk of de novo stress urinary incontinence after surgery for pelvic organ prolapse, wound infection after Cesarean delivery, transfusion during gynecologic surgery and efficacy and risk of undergoing pelvic organ prolapse surgery. These tools, although established in other fields, are innovative in the field of FPMRS and part of efforts to &ldquo;individualize&rdquo; medicine to patients with pelvic floor disorders by providing estimates of their risk for the conditions. He spends a significant proportion of time devoted to one on one mentoring of learners who are interested in learning how to build, code and test prediction models. He has significant clinical research experience as an investigator in the NICHD Pelvic Floor Disorders Network. He is the principle investigator on CAPABLe (Clinical trials.gov Identifier NCT02008565), one of the largest multi-center trials for fecal incontinence in the Pelvic Floor Disorders Network (PFDN)(U10 HD054215) studying anal exercises with biofeedback and loperamide for the treatment of fecal incontinence, and the principle investigator of E-OPTIMAL (Clinical trials.gov Identifier NCT01166373), describing the long-term follow up sacrospinous ligament fixation compared to uterosacral ligament suspension for apical vaginal prolapse.&nbsp;</p>",
